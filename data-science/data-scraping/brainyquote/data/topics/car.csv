"I am a partisan for conversation. To make room for it, I see some first, deliberate steps. At home, we can create sacred spaces: the kitchen, the dining room.

O'Rourke,"Today, Roads, End"

The city needs a car like a fish needs a bicycle.,Dean Kamen,"Fish, Bicycle, City"
"I think theatre must be an event, an experience, not compete with cinema.

It's not food if it arrived through the window of your car.,Michael Pollan,"Food, Your, Window"
"What I think is so amazing about having everything, and feeling like I have everything, is that I don't really find happiness within materialistic things.

We got out and danced around the car out on the highway.",Aretha Franklin,"Me, Night, Influence"

"I'm looking into making toilet paper. It's not an option unless you a bum and gotta use newspaper. It's not an option. Like, it's an option if you wanna drive a car.

"I hate the hand that comes out of a car and just drops litter in the street. I hate that! For some reason, it just fills me with fury!

"One of the disadvantages of poetry over popular music is that if you write a pop song, it naturally gets into people's heads as they listen in the car.

"Part of us believes the new car is better because it lasts longer. But, in fact, that's the worst thing about the new car. It will stay around to disappoint you, whereas a trip to Europe is over.

"My mom had me at 16 and took me every place she went. I remember going on peace marches. She tried to take me to Woodstock - it was pouring rain.

"Yeah, well I think anyone who likes fast cars will love the Tesla. And it has fantastic handling by the way. I mean this car will crush a Porsche on the track, just crush it.

"A lot of African Americans, especially men, deal with this as a part of life. I've been pulled over by the police in my life, and I think I've only gotten a ticket once. It's just a part of everyday life, and it doesn't matter if you're in the car with your children or by yourself.",Salim Akil,"Life, Men, Your"
"People often talk about the self-driving car and what will that do. In 32 states, the number one job is to be the driver. But remember, it's not just the driver.

"In the car on my way to premieres and awards shows, I'll sit with tissue paper under my armpits so I don't soil the delicate dress fabric.

"My accident was the result of incredible fate, with me spinning in a place I shouldn't have, with a car coming at a speed it shouldn't have, and hitting me with the sharpest and strongest thing that it has, which is the nose, in the most vulnerable part of the car, which is between the side part and the front wheel.",Alex Zanardi,"Result, Me, Fate"

"You're pulling 4-5G for a lot of the corners around the lap. We build up lactic acid because there are a lot of vibrations in the car, and you have to have strong legs to hit the brake pedal. We need to be fit to do every lap at 100%.",Jenson Button,"Build, Legs, Strong"
"I love mechanical things, older cars especially.",Brian Krzanich,"Love, Things, Older"

"Megaupload was a dual-use technology. You can use it for good things, and you can use it for bad things.

"I wanted a song my 6-year-old niece could listen to in the car.

So we're lucky it is just a lighthearted Christmas tune.",Alaska,"Christmas, Day, Sweet"
"When I grew up in the early '90s, the new World Wide Web felt like a gimmick, and I had no idea of the changes in store. In the summers, I'd backpack through Europe, follow the Grateful Dead.

"From the 1920s into the 1940s, Britain's standard of living was supported by oil from Iran. British cars, trucks, and buses ran on cheap Iranian oil.

My parents went through a back-to-the-land phase. Most of our vegetables and fruits came from our own garden.",Benjamin Percy,"Birthday, Parents, Vegetables"
"I'd been to Stourhead and was inspired by the perfect parity between architecture and art; in fact, the architecture is the art. I wrote a piece called 'Not Sculpture Park,' because most of these things become car parks for bought-in sculpture. The artists should be working with the site, not just plonking pieces down.",Charles Jencks,"Art, Architecture, Perfect"

"I'm not a big fan of self-driving cars where there's no steering wheel or brake pedal. Knowing what I know about computer vision and AI, I'd be pretty uncomfortable with that.

"I don't purposely speed, but I might go over by five or six miles an hour from time to time. It doesn't give me a buzz driving on normal roads, because I can't go fast enough. It's never going to be anything like an F1 car.",Jenson Button,"Time, Me, Roads"
"The reason I keep talking about a wife and saying the word 'wife' on stage is because it seems a funny word to me.

"I have mixed feelings about 'Car 54, Where Are You?' Because we shot it as a musical and whoever the studio head was at Orion, or whoever the powers that be were, cut all but, like, two musical numbers out of it.
