"The thing is that love gives us a ringside seat on somebody else's flaws, so of course you're gonna spot some things that kinda need to be mentioned.

Actually, true love is often about trying to teach someone how to be the best version of themselves.",Alain de Botton,"Love, Best, Love Is"

"The connection to place, to the land, the wind, the sun, stars, the moon... it sounds romantic, but it's true - the visceral experience of motion, of moving through time on some amazing machine - a few cars touch on it, but not too many compared to motorcycles. I always felt that any motorcycle journey was special.",Antoine Predock,"Experience, Time, Amazing"

"Havana, for all its smells, sweat, crumbling walls, isolation, and difficult history, is the most romantic city in the world.",Mark Kurlansky,"History, World, City"

"I think that the romantic impulse is in all of us and that sometimes we live it for a short time, but it's not part of a sensible way of living. It's a heroic path and it generally ends dangerously.

"We don't tend to write about disease in fiction - not just teen novels but all American novels - because it doesn't fit in with our idea of the heroic romantic epic. There is room only for sacrifice, heroism, war, politics and family struggle.",John Green,"Politics, Family, War"
"A lot of times, in our culture and our society, we put romantic love somehow on a higher plane than self-love and friendship love. You can't do that. You have to honor and really fully invest in all these different loving relationships.",Delilah,"Friendship, Love, Society"

I'm a hopeless romantic with a dirty mind.,Leelee Sobieski,"Mind, Dirty, Hopeless"

"I like all types of women. I accept them as they are when they come into my life... But I'm not a romantic. I'm just up-front. I like to be a part of something real, not make-believe. I tell women to tell me the truth, to just lay it out. Let me be the judge and decide if I want you around or not. Let me have my choice.",Future,"Life, Women, Truth"
I can be a romantic. The way to every woman's heart is through her stomach. Food is at the core of everything.,Paul Hollywood,"Food, Heart, Woman"

"Especially around Valentine's Day, it's easy to find advice about sustaining a successful marriage, with suggestions for 'date nights' and romantic dinners for two.

I love jazz music and sad music. I'm a sentimental guy. I'm a romantic guy.,Fred Durst,"Love, Sad, Music"
"Valentine's Day itself, like most holidays in the modern era, has been heavily influenced by commercialism that focuses on the appeal of romantic fantasies.",Aberjhani,"Valentine's Day, Day, Like"

It's a turn-off if someone's trying hard to be funny because it feels like they're auditioning for a comedy job or something. It doesn't feel romantic to me. I get so much comedy from my life that, from a guy, I'm more looking for something sweet or romantic.",Chelsea Peretti,"Life, Funny, Sweet"

Naturally I like to do, I like doing dramas, I like conflict, and when I do a comedy, you know, I've found that, like, romantic comedy is the trickiest one, because often it's neither: it's not romantic and it's not funny. So, like, I like a comedy that's biting. It's biting humor or really quirky humor.",Matt Dillon,"Funny, Humor, Conflict"

"I am not at all a romantic person, I hate flowers and candles... rather find it irritating.",Amyra Dastur,"Hate, I Am, Find"

"Sometimes I make very selfish choices; like I did 'Once Upon A Time' for my inner 8-year-old and my hypothetical future child.

"Kim Kardashian's marriage to Kris Humphries famously lasted 72 days, and was reported in the tabloids as being all about the big bucks paid by magazines for the bridal photos: it is a spectacle of a bride-to-be as entrepreneur, not as romantic heroine; the groom, in this scenario, is nothing but a prop.",Naomi Wolf,"Marriage, Nothing, Big"

"German accents and Hassidic accents aren't that romantic. They're more harsh. Although Hebrew, when spoken by certain people, sounds beautiful.

"The thing you can't let go of is gravity. The reality of gravity in writing.

I hope that I would be considered romantic. I don't know... one of my favorite movies is 'The Notebook' so I guess that would be considered romantic.

"The state of New Jersey is really two places - terrible cities and wonderful suburbs.

"I'm a romantic, but I'm not a romantic in the traditional sense. I like to romanticize what happens to me. Whatever happens to me - you could quantify it as good or bad - I romanticize it. I think along the lines of 'When that thing happened, it made me who I am.' That kind of thing. It's a different way of being romantic.",Zooey Deschanel,"Good, I Am, Me"

"I think Bond the character is distinct: He's British, he has a certain code that he lives by, he's incorruptible... he's a classical hero, but he's also fallible. He has inner demons, inner conflicts, and he's a romantic.",Barbara Broccoli,"Character, Hero, Bond"

"People expect me to be dark and gloomy, then write that I'm a jolly chap, and after all, that is what I am. I think it's a case of an absolute romantic naivety that there should be a parallel between the work and the artist.",Michael Haneke,"Work, I Am, Me"
"When you have kids and get older, it goes beyond flowers and chocolate. It's about waking up with a baby, letting her sleep in, and making a coffee for her when she wakes up.

"Are you kidding? I'm a terrible cook, but John is a really great one. Literally, I never cook. The whole time we were dating, I prepared two officially romantic meals. Both of them were such disasters that he begs me never to go into the kitchen again.",Rebecca Romijn,"Time, Great, Dating"

"The work ethic at art school is completely different than the work ethic amongst people who get into music. People who paint, it's an honorable thing to spend all day and all night in front of your canvas - that is the romantic vision of the painter.",Nick Cave,"Work, Art, Music"
I watch 'The Notebook.' I love romantic movies. I love romantic comedies.,Romeo Miller,"Love, Movies, Notebook"

I'm a real romantic.,Vanity,Real
"My books are love stories at core, really. But I am interested in manifestations of love beyond the traditional romantic notion.

I love romantic poetry.,Richard Dawkins,"Love, Poetry, I Love"
"Normally, things are viewed in these little segmented boxes. There's classical, and then there's jazz; romantic, and then there's baroque. I find that very dissatisfying. I was trying to find the thread that connects one type of music - one type of musician - to another, and to follow that thread in some kind of natural, evolutionary way.",Jerry Lee Lewis,"Music, Way, Find"
Romantic love is painful.,will.i.am,"Love, Love Is, Painful"
"I got into an argument with someone because I said I think 2Pac will be regarded as a great poet. They said he was just a punk gangster. People said the same thing about Francois Villon, and he's now considered the best French Romantic poet of all time.",Scott Glenn,"Best, Time, Great"
"There's nothing romantic about my work... I don't believe in inspiration. I believe that you get to your desk, you stay there, you work, you think of nothing else. You write and you write, and in the end, you write something good.",Irving Stone,"Work, Good, Your"
"I think in a lot of romantic comedies it ends with a kiss, and I feel like in modern day relationships, and maybe just my own experience, it starts with a kiss and then all sort of falls apart and then comes together. You're texting. You're wondering what's going on. There's no definitions, there's no labels.",Elizabeth Meriwether,"Experience, Day, Together"

Not many foreigners move to Paris for their dream job. Many do it on a romantic whim.,Pamela Druckerman,"Job, Dream, Move"

"When I was about 14 I remember thinking when it came to proposing to my future girlfriend, I'd make a CD with all her favourite songs and a message that said, 'Will you marry me?'

You're always close and you never get that big romantic lead.,Patricia Clarkson,"Always, Never, Big"
I'm really good at making teen angst romantic. I'm really good at dealing with heartbreak and things like that and making it into this whole experience.

"I don't think of myself as a romantic person; I'm kind of more rough and tumble, I think. The things I'm drawn to are outdoorsy, I only get dressed up when I have to. I'm drawn to women who are into the same type of thing. If you're going to call it romantic, I'm very spontaneous. That's probably the best thing I have going for me.",Paul Walker,"Best, Women, Myself"

"When I was growing up, my favorite movie was 'Somewhere in Time' with Christopher Reeve, which is a hugely romantic, sappy movie.

"For my parents' generation, the idea was not that marriage was about some kind of idealized, romantic love; it was a partnership. It's about creating family; it's about creating offspring.

"Shah Rukh is very romantic in real life, too.",Gauri Khan,"Life, Real, Real Life"
