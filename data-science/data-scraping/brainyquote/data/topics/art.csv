"Life is not an exact science, it is an art.",Samuel Butler,"Life, Science, Exact"
"Science fiction is any idea that occurs in the head and doesn't exist yet, but soon will, and will change everything for everybody, and nothing will ever be the same again.

"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril.

I think of that, and being able to express myself through my art and show up and be present - that's activism, advocacy, and artistry in itself.",Mj Rodriguez,"Work, Space, Myself"
"There's design, and there's art. Good design is total harmony. There's no better designer than nature - if you look at a branch or a leaf, it's perfect. It's all function. Art is different. It's about emotion. It's about suffering and beauty - but mostly suffering!",Diane von Furstenberg,"Beauty, Nature, Design"

"Food is art and science. So, you take something out, you have to work with the recipe to make sure that you're providing delicious food with cleaner labels.",Denise Morrison,"Science, Work, Food"

"Reality TV is flat with the anti-cultural imperatives of business: cheap to make, it does ideological work even when it is not giving guru status to dull business people. It fits in with capitalism's anti-mythic myth: the idea that we have liberated ourselves from the dangerous illusions allegedly propagated by art and politics.",Mark Fisher,"Work, Politics, Business"
"He who possesses art and science has religion; he who does not possess them, needs religion.",Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,"Science, Religion, Who"
"I quickly realized that this medium had a lot to offer someone like me. To do Disney-quality hand-drawn cartoons, you have to be a master of two art forms.

"What is the intersection between technology, art and science? Curiosity and wonder, because it drives us to explore, because we're surrounded by things we can't see.",Louie Schwartzberg,"Science, Technology, Curiosity"
"In art, at a certain level, there is no 'better than.' It's just about trying to operate for yourself on the most supreme level, artistically, that you can and hoping that people get it. Trusting that, just because of the way people are built and how interconnected we are, greatness will translate and symmetry will be recognised.",Frank Ocean,"Yourself, Better, Greatness"
"Of course the illusion of art is to make one believe that great literature is very close to life, but exactly the opposite is true. Life is amorphous, literature is formal.",Francoise Sagan,"Life, Great, Believe"

All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music.,Walter Pater,"Music, Condition, Towards"
Art is an attempt to integrate evil.,Simone de Beauvoir,"Evil, Attempt, Integrate"

"Women are our most miraculous muse, an enchanted intangibility that encourages all art.",CeeLo Green,"Women, Muse, Women Are"

"At the end of the day, I just do my job. I love my art.",Millie Bobby Brown,"Love, Day, End Of The Day"

"We are probably the only artists in the world who have a 2,000-page book on a work of art that doesn't exist. But in this way, these projects reveal their identity through this whole process.

"The moment you think you understand a great work of art, it's dead for you.",Oscar Wilde,"Work, Great, Moment"
"What I've discovered is that in art, as in music, there's a lot of truth-and then there's a lie.

It's the moment that the audience falls in love.",Lady Gaga,"Love, Work, Truth"

"In France, cooking is a serious art form and a national sport.",Julia Child,"Food, Cooking, Serious"
