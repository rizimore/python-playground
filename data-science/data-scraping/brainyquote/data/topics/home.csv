"Racism is taught in the home. We agree on that? Well, it's very hard to teach racism to a teenager who's listening to rap music and who idolizes, say, Snoop Dogg.

Home is wherever I hang my hat.,Miriam Margolyes,"Hat, Hang, Wherever"
"We speak of 'software eating the world,' 'the Internet of Things,' and we massify 'data' by declaring it 'Big.' But these concepts remain for the most part abstract.

"If you want to be an entrepreneur, it's not a job, it's a lifestyle. It defines you.

I do miss Glasgow but Malibu is home now. I love it here and when I do go back to Scotland it takes me a bit of time to acclimatise. I am a spoilt so-and-so.

"Memorial Day isn't just about honoring veterans, its honoring those who lost their lives. Veterans had the fortune of coming home.

"I have four sisters at home, and both my mom and dad worked, and both of them took care of us.

"There's a very real possibility in this industry of going out and leading your life and then going home and being a voyeur of your own life.

"It's natural canine behavior to chew on all sorts of things, roll in other animals' droppings, hump and fight other dogs, menace anything that invades the home.

"As my father taught me, and he drove home that point, he said, 'Just remember something. You don't need to tell anybody how good you are. You show them how good you are.'

"I used to love the Wu-Tang Clan. They took my school by storm, by which I mean the three kids in my year who listened to hip-hop. I skipped lectures to go and buy their second album, 'Forever', and then rushed home to listen to it.",Romesh Ranganathan,"Love, Storm, School"

"I consider myself fortunate that in my home, acting or the creative arts were a good option. This was a respected tour of duty in my family. Acting wasn't something that was left to tragic bohemians. But we weren't a family that obsessed on cinema.",Sean Penn,"Family, Good, Myself"

"When TV came, people said who will go to theatres to watch movies? When the Internet came, they said the same. And now it's the digital media...

It's jarring to live in a world where every person feels his life will only get better when you came from a world where many rightfully believe that things have become worse.

"At first, I found the music I was making really hard to find a home for. I felt like my attitude was really British, but not the actual sounds I was making. Back in 2003, when I made 'Galang,' there were no clubs that had an 'anything and everything' attitude.",M.I.A.,"Attitude, Music, Find"

"The home phone is relatively cheap, incredibly reliable, and - if you buy the right phone - will work for years without replacement.

Now I don't want to be Mr. Show Business anymore.",Alec Baldwin,"Life, Family, Business"

"Montreal is my home town - I love it to death - but Toronto, I think, might have to be the best market in Canada. From a numbers perspective, it definitely is.

"There have been times when I have goofed up, and like every adolescent, I sometimes did get led the wrong way.

"Love is music, and music is home.",Paolo Nutini,"Love, Music, Love Is"
"Most lawyers aren't trial lawyers. Most lawyers, even trial lawyers, don't get their problems solved in a courtroom. We like to go to court. It seems heroic to go to court.
