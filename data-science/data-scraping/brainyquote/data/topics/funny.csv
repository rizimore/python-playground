"I think I have a dark view of the world. I have to make everything funny, otherwise it all seems so sad.",Moon Unit Zappa,"Sad, World, View"
"You never saw Peter Sellers the actor trying to make you laugh. All he was doing was the character. What I'm saying is that I don't think you should know you're in a movie. I don't like it when actors are winking at the audience and saying, 'Right, isn't this funny? Are you with me?'",Steve Carell,"Character, Me, Laugh"
"It's funny how the hippies and the punks tried to get rid of the conservatives, but they always seem to get the upper hand in the end.",Bjork,"Always, End, In The End"
"I think I was the only person in my experimental film class doing comedy. But my sense of humor and a lot of comedy that I love is quite surreal and strange, you know? You could argue that 'Monty Python' is experimental film. It just happens to be really funny.",Andy Samberg,"Love, Humor, Love Is"
"If it bends, it's funny; if it breaks, it's not funny.",Kate O'Brien,"Breaks, Bends"

"It's funny, because there are so many stereotypes out there about actors and movie stars in general, but I've had a great opportunity to meet a lot of them, and maybe it's just because they don't behave that way around me, but I rarely see that kind of abuse of power.",Ryan Reynolds,"Power, Great, Opportunity"
"I don't think comedy necessarily comes from a dark place. But I do think what a lot of us have in common is that, growing up, being funny was a coping mechanism.",Sean Hayes,"Dark, Comedy, Place"

"I've never seen Kendrick Lamar crack a joke, and I've met him, but I'm sure he's hilarious, too, just because he's so good at rapping. J. Cole is a funny guy as well. Drake is funny. But who's the funniest guy I've met who is a rapper? I would say 50 Cent.",Jay Pharoah,"Good, Just Because, Never"
It's funny how getting older - or being overlooked and underrated for more than two decades - can make you change your ambitions.,Reg E. Cathey,"Change, Your, Getting Older"
"Who knew Rob Lowe was funny? On 'Parks and Rec,' we've got some of the funniest comedy writers, some of the funniest comedians in the world working there.

"My background is all comedy. I've been doing improv since I was 17. It's funny, because when I meet people, I'm known as this guy who will punch you in the face or throw you out a window, when I also have a background in comedy.",Derek Mears,"Window, Face, Doing"
"The American audience has really opened up to women being A.) funny and B.) kinda crude. 'Bridesmaids' is R-rated, and I think it was a major coup for women to have an R-rated comedy that did really well. Same as 'Bad Teacher.'",Chris Pratt,"Women, Teacher, Bad"
What I find funny are peoples' blind spots. That's the funniest thing about anybody - when they just don't realize who they are. What's funny about seeing a hippo do ballet is it thinks it's a swan.,Sam Richardson,"Blind, Find, Swan"

"Kevin Hart. He's the man! I like his style. He's short, so I can relate. All the stories he tells are real. I respect that, and he's just a really funny dude - great comedy instincts.

"I mean, autographs are so funny. I don't think it's good to encourage that sort of thing. Why do people want to have an autograph? What does it do for you?",Hope Sandoval,"Good, People, Why"
"I wasn't close to my father, but I wanted to be all my life. He had a funny sense of humor, and he laughed all the time - good and loud, like I do.

"It's funny, when bands or younger musicians ask me: 'So, what does it take to make it?' Well, first explain to me what you mean by 'making it': Do you want to be a rock star or do you want music to be your livelihood?",Eddie Van Halen,"Music, Famous, Your"
"It's a funny thing that when a man hasn't anything on earth to worry about, he goes off and gets married.",Robert Frost,"Wedding, Man, Worry"

"I can apply myself to the format of 'SNL,' I can apply myself to the format of 'Conan,' but at the same time, I'm still being J. B. Smoove. I'm not changing up my style, I'm not changing up how I think, what's funny to me, my delivery, the way I carry myself.",J. B. Smoove,"Time, Myself, Me"
"You cannot dictate what people find funny, what people find attractive, or what people find scary. There is not a norm.",Guillermo del Toro,"Find, People, Attractive"

"I always thought 'chick lit' meant third-person contemporary funny novels, dealing with issues of the day. I mean, it's not the ideal term; when I'm asked to describe what I do, I say I write romantic comedies, cause that's what I feel they are. But I'm quite pragmatic.",Sophie Kinsella,"Romantic, Always, Day"

And the guy next to him says, 'What did he say?'",Bob Newhart,"Me, Laugh, Circle"

I think anyone who's perfectly happy isn't particularly funny.,Joan Rivers,"Happy, Think, Anyone"
"Wine is similar to music in that it's a purely experiential realm, and it's a purely subjective practice. That's sort of the funny thing about wine criticism or, for that matter, music criticism.

I tend to head for what's amusing because a lot of things aren't happy. But usually you can find a funny side to practically anything.,Maggie Smith,"Find, Happy, Anything"

"Our characters act silly, even totally ridiculous at times, and most of our jokes don't come out of pop cultural references.

You can kind of let go.",Stephen Hillenburg,"Humor, World, Laugh"
"I love New York. I was sad, depressed and incredibly moved by our fellow countrymen and what they've done. I wanted to give people a chance to see something funny, have a distraction.",Ben Stiller,"Love, Sad, Chance"
"When I first envisioned 'Funny Games' in the mid-1990s, it was my intention to have an American audience watch the movie. It is a reaction to a certain American cinema, its violence, its naivety, the way American cinema toys with human beings. In many American films, violence is made consumable.",Michael Haneke,"Cinema, Way, Toys"
"My favorite kind of humor is basically, if it was happening to you, it wouldn't be funny, but to observe it, it's hilarious.",Bill Burr,"Humor, Observe, Favorite"

"If something becomes mean-spirited and hurtful, it's not funny.",Tom Green,"Something, Hurtful, Becomes"
"This may sound funny, but as much as the 'Today' show matured me, it also was something of a cocoon. I'd been happy there. I never went into the boss's office and pounded my fist on the desk, saying, 'Give me more money! Give me a prime-time show!'",Jane Pauley,"Money, Today, Boss"
I find it really funny that men can always get away with being a ladies man. Everyone thinks it's really cool. But a girl can't really date boys all the time because everybody looks down on her. I think boys get away with things so much easier.,Jade Thirlwall,"Time, Cool, Men"
"Back when Sammy Davis, Jr. and Dean Martin were doing roasts, they were all friends. They knew each other's children, each other's wives, each other's families. It wasn't about being disrespectful. It was about being funny.",Charlie Murphy,"Doing, Children, Back"

I guess what I always found funny was the human condition.,John Prine,"Always, Human, Guess"

"If you're talking about Java in particular, Python is about the best fit you can get amongst all the other languages. Yet the funny thing is, from a language point of view, JavaScript has a lot in common with Python, but it is sort of a restricted subset.",Guido van Rossum,"Best, View, Language"
"I write funny. If I can make my wife laugh, I know I'm on the right track.",Gene Wilder,"Wife, Laugh, Know"

"Karaoke isn't fair when you're a comedian. The whole idea is to get people laughing and enjoying themselves, and I'm a professional funny guy.",Chris Rock,"People, Professional, Fair"
"Eddie Murphy said once in an interview that nothing is offensive if it's funny. I sort of agree with that, but if something's funny and you're the subject of it, sometimes it's more offensive. If someone's insulting you, you want them to sound like an idiot.",Artie Lange,"Nothing, Sometimes, Idiot"

"It's funny. People often compare me to other humor essayists. They're usually quite nice comparisons; I will accept those gladly. But I am always sort of appalled at the idea of being lumped with other, more chick-y female writers. And the truth is probably that neither comparison is accurate.",Sloane Crosley,"Truth, Humor, Always"
"Don't remember me as too nice or beautiful or funny, because then you'll be disappointed.",Celia Johnson,"Beautiful, Remember, Me"
"There's magic all around us: Our smartphones are magical, 3-D printers are magical.

And funny.",Michael Carbonaro,"Believe, Feel, Enough"

I've got a sense of humor. I'm a funny guy.,Daryl Hall,"Humor, Sense Of Humor, Sense"
"I have been working as an actor for 16-17 years now. The funny thing is I still feel awkward in communicating with the public as a star. It hasn't been long since my drama 'Goblin' ended, and I'm looking forward for some time to rest.",Gong Yoo,"Time, Long, Rest"

"The follow your dreams thing is really important because so many people are railroaded into taking other paths by their family, their friends, people who should be supportive going, 'What are you talking about?'

"Reality is like a doughnut: Everything that is good and funny and juicy is outside the center, which is just emptiness.",Olga Tokarczuk,"Good, Reality, Emptiness"
I think I'm one of those guys who was sort of always in comedy. I thought of myself - and other people seemed to think of me - as funny from a very young age. I was a very young comedy nerd and I even did sketch comedy in high school and college. I wrote and shot sketches on video and acted in them.,Andy Daly,"Age, Myself, Always"
"The reason I keep talking about a wife and saying the word 'wife' on stage is because it seems a funny word to me.

"My main point is to be funny; if I can slip a message in there, fine.",Flip Wilson,"I Can, Point, Fine"

It is possible in this world to be pretty and funny and successful all at the same time.,Olivia Munn,"Time, World, Possible"
"My mom was funny and nutty. I suppose she had to be to survive raising 10 kids. To cope and keep a cap on things, she kept us buoyant and harmonious.

"When in a movie like 'Housefull' you have to create comedy out of falling on a glass table or jumping from huge heights, it's all action, but packaged as comedy. Here you don't just have to perform a heavy-duty action sequence, but you have to make it look funny and that is really difficult. But it's fun... and I really enjoy it.",Lara Dutta,"Look, Difficult, Action"
"With any of the movies I've had a chance to do, or any of the TV shows I've had a chance to contribute to, people approach me and say, 'Hey, would you like to do this?'

"Lewis Carroll, you see, wasn't really interested in telling an exciting story. Well, he wasn't interested in things like cause and effect or a linear narrative. It's surreal, it's absurd, it's wordplay, it's satirical, it's analyzing itself, it's funny, it's an enormous challenge.",James Bobin,"Challenge, Story, See"
"Doug Stanhope is great - I saw his 'Burning the Bridge to Nowhere' show and it was inspiring. He's like an anti-shaman, taking the sting out of a bunch of things we've chosen to give a symbolic power to. I've made it sound noble and worthy there, it's not, it's really funny.",Frankie Boyle,"Power, Great, Bridge"

I'm not one to sit here and judge here. But I think it's funny that the people that condemn the adult industry the most are the ones consuming the product the most.,Sasha Grey,"People, Product, Sit"
"Political satire is a serious thing. In democratic newspapers throughout the world there are daily cartoons that often are not even funny, as is the case especially in many English-language newspapers. Instead, they contain a political message, and the artist takes full responsibility.",Umberto Eco,"Daily, Political, Responsibility"
"When life partner happens, I hope he is not a youth icon then because I doubt even I would be youthful then. Whether life partner is hot or not, that doesn't matter. He has to be a nice man.

"Of the Queen tributes, some of them are very funny, and some of them are really not funny at all.

"There's only a handful of people who are just purely, inherently funny, and I'm not one of them. I need content and a situation. I don't just walk on the screen, and people go, 'Ha ha ha!' There are people like that, and they can do almost anything. It's the Christopher Walken Rule.",Gary Cole,"Walk, Situation, People"
Kyriakos Papadopoulos is really funny. So is Karim Bellarabi. They are full of jokes in the dressing room.,Son Heung-min,"Room, Jokes, Full"

It's when you put all these things together - that makes me.",George Harrison,"Great, Myself, Together"

"There's something outrageously funny about the bold-faced lying that's going on, in a general way. Just the blatant denial of facts, whether it's climate change or crowd sizes. Every day, there's another blatant lie. I think there's comedy in there somewhere.",Matt Walsh,"Change, Day, Lie"
Comedians' first ten minutes usually stay with them the first several years of their career. It's their mission statement. Their disclaimer that lets people know who they are. Or were. It's also a good time to make fun of your name if you have a funny or strange one.,Bob Saget,"Good, Time, Your"
"There's a funny thing about fame. The truth is you run as fast as you can towards it because it's everything you want. Not just the fame but what it represents, meaning work, meaning opportunity. And then you get there, and it's shocking how immediately you become enveloped in this world that is incredibly restricting.",George Clooney,"Work, Truth, Opportunity"
Most of my ideas just come out funny.,Tim Heidecker,"Ideas, Come, Just"

"Once an actor told me he went to the Shakespeare School of Acting, and I said, 'I went to the Shakespeare of Acting, too' and he said, 'Oh really?' And I said, 'I went to Shakespeare Elementary School in Chicago.' He didn't take the joke well, he didn't laugh and didn't think it was funny - I thought it was funny. It's all the same to me.",Michael Clarke Duncan,"Me, Laugh, School"
"I'm actually a big fan of Kathy Griffin because I think she's really funny. I think she's really self-deprecating, which is something I like to see in a comedian. I think those are really the best comedians: people who can make fun of themselves.",Chelsea Handler,"Best, People, Fun"
"If you're going to take a jab at someone, you should at least have a bit more of a personal relationship with them. I feel like you can be funny and clever, as opposed to just outright vile.",Harland Williams,"Relationship, Feel, Someone"

"The less lines, the better. I am the silent film actor, but not in a slapstick sort of way. Film is an image-based medium, so whatever you can say without the words is far more provocative and punctuating. If the lines are not funny or if they don't advance the story, sometimes it's hard. I hate talk in movies.",Callum Keith Rennie,"Movies, Hate, Better"

"The fact that 'A Dirty Job' has comedy and supernatural horror in it, that both are woven in and out of it with a whimsical tone, despite the fact that it's about death, makes it hard to characterize with standard genre labels - but I have no problem with that. I'd call it a funny story about death, and leave it at that.",Christopher Moore,"Death, Dirty, Job"
"Isn't it funny how babies laugh a lot? I read a toddler, a young child laughs 300 times a day. The average adult laughs, like, four times a day. God put it in them. He put the laugh in us, but I think sometimes we let life get us down, you know, have bad breaks, and we lose our breaks.",Joel Osteen,"Life, God, Day"
"For me, 'Jaws' is much more of an adventure movie, but when it's scary, it's terrifying. When it's funny, it's hilarious. When there's drama, it's the most sincere stuff on screen. When there's adventure, there's swashbuckle. It's all those things.",Dan Trachtenberg,"Me, Sincere, Adventure"
"Our pious horror at the intolerant and repressive behaviour of Islamic State is bitterly funny, given that it is really not that different from the policies of our close ally, Saudi Arabia.",Peter Hitchens,"Different, Behaviour, State"

"It seems like everybody's perception of me is very bipolar. To one group, it's overpaid, overrated; to another group, it's underpaid, underrated, underdog. It's funny to me because there's no real balance.",Jeremy Lin,"Me, Balance, Perception"
"I applied the same mentality to my social media as I did when I was doing my boot camps. I thought, well, no one's watching, but I'll keep adding value, putting out good recipes, funny workouts and good videos. And it grew and grew.",Joe Wicks,"Good, Social Media, Value"
"I've seen many female comics that a lot of people haven't heard of who are so funny, and I saw them come up, and they were working so hard, and then all of a sudden they had a baby, and they just got tied up in motherhood, and eventually, they kind of just stopped doing stand-up, and I thought it was such a shame.",Ali Wong,"Doing, People, Shame"
"It was funny to run into girls I knew after the movie came out because they would say, 'I saw you on 'Magic Mike,' but there was this look of embarrassment. It was very cute.",Adam Rodriguez,"Look, Magic, Cute"
"Patrick is vey modest about using the Sir thing and I just inherited it by marriage, so more than anything it's just kind of a funny little thing that we call one another from time to time. He calls me 'His Ladyship', which is just hilarious.",Sunny Ozell,"Time, Marriage, Me"

"There are people who think the film 'This Is Spinal Tap' is simply a very funny 'mockumentary.' Well, with Yes, we lived it. Take the hilarious scene in the film in which the bass player is trapped in a giant pod - that actually happened to Alan one night.",Rick Wakeman,"Night, People, Well"
"It's funny, the moment you dread the most, seeing yourself bald, is actually not such a bad moment at all.",Sylvie Meis,"Moment, Yourself, Bad"

"I love some of the most hateful tweets. I think they're very funny. In the negative attacks on me, there are frequently some real displays of humor.

"I guess when you turn off the main road, you have to be prepared to see some funny houses.",Stephen King,"Road, Be Prepared, Turn"

Do you want me to apologize after every joke? If it doesn't offend somebody it's probably not a joke. It's probably an observation that's not funny. It's gotta offend somebody somewhere.,Jeff Ross,"Me, Observation, Somewhere"
"Eyebrows are really important because they structure the face. In school it was funny because I was always the one walking around with tweezers plucking my girlfriends' eyebrows.

"It's just my natural way - to be funny. I don't know why that is. But as I've said, humor is a quick cover for shock, horror, confusion. The critics hate funny writers for the most part. They think funny is not serious, but I think that funny can be even more serious than nonfunny. And it can be more affecting, too.",T. C. Boyle,"Humor, Hate, Way"
"Funny songs aren't usually that good. Like Weird Al and maybe a couple of Beatles songs, but it's kind of hard to bring humor into rock music in an interesting way.",Win Butler,"Good, Humor, Music"
"It's so funny because if you tweet your lyrics and then you hear it in a song next week, you're like, 'Hey I had that same idea.' I'm very secretive with my music.

"I don't want to sound hoity-toity, but people told me I should watch 'Cheers' because it's very funny. So I watched it, and I just went, 'This is the great show of the universe?' To me, acting is making characters believable, not just doing jokes.",Teri Garr,"Great, Universe, Me"

It was funny because I found out I was doing the film and then a week later, I was in Shanghai.",Eliza Coupe,"Romantic, Doing, America"

"I don't feel that I'm explaining the world or teaching people anything. And I'm not trying to be a mirror, showing them what's really going on the world. All I'm trying to do is think of stuff that's funny, just like when I'm kidding around with my friends.",Steven Wright,"Mirror, World, Feel"
I thought I was funny as a kid.,Jo Brand,"Thought, Kid"

"I detest jokes - when somebody tells me one, I feel my IQ dropping; the brain cells start to disappear.

Maybe it comes from a place of truth, or it's a sort of rage against society.",Johnny Depp,"Truth, Society, Brain"

"It's funny, in literature no one ever goes to the lavatory.",Tom Baker,"Literature, Ever, Goes"
