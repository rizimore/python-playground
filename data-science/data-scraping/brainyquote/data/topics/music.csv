And I was seeing the thread that was connecting everything together, which is pretty much the blues. And everything soul or funk kind of starts with that.",D'Angelo,"Together, Soul, Me"

I'm a DJ who makes dance music who got to play with Sting.,Afrojack,"Dance, DJ, Play"
"I think my style is quite grungy and punky. I love the '90s and the music from that time, and I love punk music. I'm also a fan of mixing vintage with some high fashion, which links back to my musical taste because I tend to mix old music with newer songs.",Chelsea Leyland,"Love, Time, Vintage"

"Our house is a constant mayhem of music, noise, socializing and business. It vibrates life, as a house should.",Dan Hill,"Life, Business, Noise"

"Poetry itself is music. I'm just lucky that I can convert it into music. William Blake is my favorite poet of all time, and he said that he wasn't quite familiar with the sounds of music. If so, he would have been a musician. All of his poems are all like songs, and that's how I always try to start my thoughts.",Benjamin Clementine,"Time, Poetry, Always"

"If Death Grips isn't the fourth horseman of a hip-hop apocalypse, its music at least tests the genre's threshold of extremity: The trio's abrasive, jittery style teeters on the edge of palatability, and plays toward a morbid curiosity to which many listeners won't succumb.",Anthony Fantano,"Death, Curiosity, Style"

"Truth of the matter is, jazz is American music. And that doesn't mean bebop. Jazz is really about improvising. All the music that's been created in America has been pretty much improvised...

"If you don't die of thirst, there are blessings in the desert. You can be pulled into limitlessness, which we all yearn for, or you can do the beauty of minutiae, the scrimshaw of tiny and precise.
