It's all those wonderful things that a fantastic drama is about.",Liam Cunningham,"God, Power, Jealousy"

"'Mom' is an emotional family drama that's also thrilling. It's the story about a mother and a daughter, their emotions, and how their lives change. Being a mother myself helped me understand those emotions better.",Sridevi,"Change, Mom, Myself"
"Early in my career, I didn't want to disappoint my colleagues, clients, or family. So I said yes to everything.

Dubner,"Your, World, Problems"
"I was born into a very religious family where everything was about setting the right example for the community and having to obey orders blindly.
