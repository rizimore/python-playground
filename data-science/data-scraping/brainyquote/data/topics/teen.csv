That is, in middle age I moved to a seaside town and got into a right barney with the local powers-that-be.",Julie Burchill,"Age, Great, Never"
"I fell in love with Erica Kane the summer before my freshman year of high school.

"When I started out as a music journalist, at the end of the 1980s, it was generally assumed that we were living through the lamest music era the world would ever see.

"My first job in TV was hosting this young teen magazine show, and all these high school teenagers showed up from all over Sacramento, California, and they chose four of us to host the show, two boys and two girls.

There's a few of them that make it out and a few of them that don't.",Kid Rock,"Good, Always, Know"

"If you have a famous parent, you know that being famous doesn't make you superior to anyone else. It just means people smile at you more.

"The endless teen franchises that come out of Hollywood... more often than not, the central character doesn't have any discernible character traits.

They're always played by fantastic young actors, but ultimately, they're not very interesting characters.",Taron Egerton,"Journey, Always, Character"
"I'm definitely of the 'Harry Potter'-transfigured-me-into-a-reader-and-writer generation. And that's really all I read throughout my teen years, because I really devoted all my time to writing and reading friends' fan-fiction.",Adam Silvera,"Time, Generation, Reading"
"When I was a teen, I would draw a really, really long line around my eyes with eyeliner, like Lola Flores.",Rosalia,"Eyes, Long, Like"

The phrase 'teen hottie' literally makes me want to throw up.,Lorde,"Me, Want, Throw"
"People ask me, 'How's 'Teen Wolf?' and I tell them it's literally the best job I've ever had. It's hard. Everybody wants to be a series regular. It's something that a lot of actors would kill to have. That being said, it's very demanding of you, in so many different ways.",Shelley Hennig,"Best, Me, People"
"I went down the creative path in my teen years, and when I was in high school, in my junior year, I would perform at this program that was very similar to 'School of Rock.' That was when I started writing and realized that's what I wanted to do.",Amber Mark,"Path, School, Down"
"As a teenager, I didn't read a ton of teen fiction, and now I feel like I wish that I had.",Jesse Andrews,"Feel, Wish, I Wish"

Those are the people who spend time out of their day to watch the things that I've done, and I've gotten to do some great supernatural stuff - 'Teen Wolf' and 'The Gates' before that - so it's nice when I get to go to Comic-Con every year.",Colton Haynes,"Love, Time, Great"
My first encounter with Cyborg was through the 'Teen Titans' cartoon.,Ray Fisher,"First, Through, Cartoon"

"'Teen Vogue' is so much more than just a magazine. It's so much more than just a website. It's so much more than social.

"I didn't have a teen age at all. I didn't even look at boys, never mind... then suddenly it was like, 'Oh my god!' So I made up for a lot of lost time very quickly. It was kind of bonkers. Working hard, partying hard - but also experiencing life, you know.",Anne-Marie Duff,"Life, God, Time"

"I think the feeling was that 'Venture Brothers' really has something to sell in terms of a feature. 'Aqua Teen' is an element minute cartoon, and its very subversive and non sequitur and weird. We were writing the one show where we were constantly like, 'God, I wish we had another hour to tell this story.' It seemed like a natural fit.",Christopher McCulloch,"God, Wish, Weird"
"It's important for Asian American kids to see themselves in stories and to feel seen. They need to know that their stories are universal, too, that they, too, can fall in love in a teen movie. They don't have to be the sidekick; they can be the hero.",Jenny Han,"Love, Hero, Important"
"I've watched presidential debates since I was a teen, and I love it.",Stephen A. Smith,"Love, Since, Watched"

I know these girls are starving themselves.' But they probably would go out and buy the thing eventually.",Alissa Quart,"Women, Research, Laugh"

Having been through the process myself as a musician, since I was an early teen, gave me an advantage - understanding them from their point of view, because it's about them, it's not about you - it's their vision and what they're capable of achieving, and you're the conduit.",Tommy Mottola,"Myself, Vision, View"
"If I can write a book that will help the world make a little more sense to a teen, then that's why I was put on the planet.",Laurie Halse Anderson,"World, Will, I Can"

"It's easy to feel like you don't have any control over yourself or your life or your body as a teen - everything is changing so fast, and a lot of it feels so outside of your power.

Ric Flair was such a huge part of my childhood and teen years. He's an icon.,Darius Rucker,"Childhood, Icon, He"

"With any teen show, there's going to be drama and heartache.",Lili Reinhart,"Drama, Heartache, Show"

The best thing I can say about 'Teen Wolf Too' is that it's the only time anyone ever referred to me as Preston Sturges. Leonard Maltin wrote that 'Teen Wolf Too' made 'Teen Wolf' look like Preston Sturges. I've always prided myself on that.,Jeph Loeb,"Best, Time, Myself"

"When 'Teen Vogue' started out, 'Teen Vogue' was an aspirational fashion magazine for fashion lovers. You know, it was the little sister to 'Vogue.'

"I could have been on a path that led to different, more traditional teen romance, and 'Nip/Tuck' shook me loose from any generalization I might have been forced into.

"The average teen today spends about 35 hours a week in front of a screen of some kind: iPod, movie, TV, video. And a lot of it is good, but a lot of it's not. And so I think you've got that five hours a day of media coming into your kid's head that's creating a lot of havoc out there.",Sean Covey,"Good, Today, Your"
"I just fell into the job as a fashion editor at a teen magazine. I was there for two years, and I left there as a senior fashion editor at the age of 25.",Rachel Zoe,"Age, Fashion, Job"

"There was never a book, a magazine, a movie, a television show that spoke to my experience as a bicultural teen.

I hate it when people call me a teen queen.,Lindsay Lohan,"Hate, Queen, Me"
"Costumes say a lot about a character. When it came to 'Palo Alto,' it was important for me that the kids didn't look perfect. In most teen movies today, all of the clothes are expensive. I remember wearing a lot of dirty vintage clothes.",Gia Coppola,"Movies, Today, Character"
"A surprising number of American skyjackers were not yet old enough to drink or sometimes even drive.

Koerner,"Success, Gun, Drive"

That was one thing my parents made very clear.",Mona Eltahawy,"Your, Parents, Remember"
I actually hope people don't react to 'Impossible' in a way where they think it's terribly retro. The plot needed to do what it needed to do.

"As I got older, I had a bunch of friends that were various teen stars. I've always known people in the spotlight and people who just grew up in L.A. and had nothing to do with the industry.

"I have a very large shoebox overflowing with lyrics I've been writing and collecting since my teen years and into my late 20s, with lyrics from all walks of my life.

She really created an iconic character.",Robyn Lively,"Mom, Vision, Character"
"Because of people like that guy in San Francisco who told me it changed his life, 'Teen Witch' is my most favorite thing I've ever done. I see how happy it makes people, and that makes me happy.

Trump gets too much credit for 'Teen Vogue''s evolution.,Elaine Welteroth,"Credit, Evolution, Much"

It wasn't because we didn't like each other. We just liked reading. The person who made my reading list until my late teen years was my mom.",Keith Gessen,"Family, Mom, Person"
"One of the things that defines YA is a really strong narrative. Adults love YA because, at the end of the day, they're good stories and page-turners. The other element is emotion.
