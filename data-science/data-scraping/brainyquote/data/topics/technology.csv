"If you wanna know how not secure you are, just take a look around. Nothing's secure. Nothing's safe.

"We face cyber threats from state-sponsored hackers, hackers for hire, global cyber syndicates, and terrorists.

So I'm always down in my basement, singing along to riffs or whoever I'm collaborating with.",Sebastian Bach,"Always, Your, New"
Technology steers what 2 billion people are thinking and believing every day. It's possibly the largest source of influence over 2 billion people's thoughts that has ever been created.

"The Internet is the first technology since the printing press which could lower the cost of a great education and, in doing so, make that cost-benefit analysis much easier for most students.

"Did you ever spell a word so bad that your spell check has absolutely no clue what you're trying to spell? What do you end up getting, you end up getting, like, a question mark. You got a million dollars of technology just looking back at you like, 'You got me, buddy. Which is pretty amazing because I have all the words.'",Bill Burr,"Amazing, Your, Looking Back"
"I like that in 'Caprica' the virtual world is a new thing. The parents didn't have that growing up. And it's the same thing about the Internet and all the current technology.

India and Japan should develop a complementary relationship in information technology.,Yoshiro Mori,"Relationship, Information, India"
"There are more humans than all of the rabbits on earth. There are more of us than all the wildebeests, than all the rats, than all the mice. We are the most numerous mammal on the planet.

Many people recognize that technology often comes with unintended and undesirable side effects.,Leon Kass,"People, Side, Often"
"I see film as a real opportunity to examine the human condition. No matter where the technology goes in the future, the basics don't change. Storytelling is a primitive tribal function.

"Theaters are always going to be around, and doing fine. With computers and technology, we're becoming more and more secluded from each other.

"The biggest challenge is that when people look at low price point products, they essentially invest less money in development, innovation, and new technology.

But that's counterintuitive for a lot of businesses.",Yves Behar,"Money, Look, Challenge"
"I drove an electric car for seven years because of its advanced technology, not because I have any concerns about energy resources. I have none at all.

Even when builders pound nails by the thousand with pneumatic nail guns, every household needs a hammer.",James Gleick,"Will, Guns, Never"
"Technology isn't the enemy, it is our ally, but only if we adopt a new model that puts people before profit.

Hope is the last thing to die.",Justin Sane,"Hope, Beautiful, Die"

"There's been resistance to every new technology that's ever been introduced. When books came out hundreds of years ago, there were complaints that it would destroy the oral tradition. Some of those fears were justified, but it didn't stop the rise of the written word. And books have proven to be incredibly useful.",Jeremy Stoppelman,"Rise, New, Stop"

"Once you change the technology - from a film camera to a video camera, or from an 8-mm camera to 16 mm - you change completely the content. With 8 mm, a leaf on a tree will be made up of maybe four grains. So it's very impressionistic, almost like Seurat. If you switch to 16 mm, the technology gives you hundreds of grains on that leaf.",Jonas Mekas,"Change, Tree, Leaf"

The financial world is at the cutting edge of high technology.,Robert Harris,"World, Edge, Financial"
I believe 3D is inevitable because it's about aligning our entertainment systems to our sensory system. We all have two eyes; we all see the world in 3D.

"The immediacy of the technology of the web allows us, as songwriters, to write something very sharp and quick.
