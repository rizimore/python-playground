"I've felt for some time that economics needs to be taught differently by economists who actually have had experience making a payroll or investing on Wall Street. When economics is taught by pure academics, watch out.",Mark Skousen,"Time, Economics, Street"
"Google Now is one of those products that to many users doesn't seem like a product at all. It is instead the experience one has when you use the Google Search application on your Android or iPhone device (it's consistently a top free app on the iTunes charts). You probably know it as Google search, but it's far, far more than that.",John Battelle,"Your, Free, Search"

Travel is a new experience that can transport you out of your everyday routine to create memories with the ones you love.,Brian Chesky,"Love, Travel, Memories"
"It's a bit cliche, but you can't go wrong by writing what you know. Even if you're a horrible writer, your own knowledge and experience is unrivaled. Nobody knows what you know like you know what you know. The way you see things is pretty unique.",Issa Rae,"Knowledge, Your, Way"
"When you label so much of what happens to you as 'bad,' it reinforces the feeling that you are a powerless pawn at the mercy of outside forces over which you have no control. And - this is key - labeling something a bad thing almost guarantees that you'll experience it as such.",Srikumar Rao,"Control, Mercy, Bad"
"It's probably cliche to say this, but in my experience, people are far more alike than they are dissimilar.",Alexandra Fuller,"People, Far, Say"

"If you experience that feeling of being in a rut in your life, then something's not right. A lot of people who feel that way don't take the time to say, 'O.K., well, what am I doing? Is that what I want to be doing? What is it making me feel this way?' You have to identify what specifically is making you feel stuck.",Joy Mangano,"Life, Time, Your"
"I know we're all addicted to our smartphones, and I'll say, if I forget my smartphone, I go home and get it.

I didn't know what to do with all the fear and emotions within, and here was the Buddha saying this truth right out loud.",Sharon Salzberg,"Life, Truth, Fear"
"I've used my experience from playing sports in almost every aspect of my life.

It was a great experience to work with director A. L. Vijay.,Keerthy Suresh,"Work, Great, Director"
"There's very little you could do to prepare to be a correspondent on 'The Daily Show,' because it's not being a journalist, it's not being an actor. It involves elements of both of those things, but they're not required necessarily as job experience. It's helpful if you know how to improvise, but again, not a requirement.",Steve Carell,"Daily, Know, Job"
Many comedians and comedy writers have shared the childhood experience of learning to joke to protect themselves from neighborhood bullies when challenge or physical defense were not among the sensible options.,Steve Allen,"Learning, Childhood, Challenge"

"I'm a huge stadium rock fan, but I'm also a fan of everything from Massive Attack to Peter Gabriel, U2, the Police, Radiohead, and Coldplay.

"I think with experience and age, you gain knowledge and wisdom.",Nick Foles,"Wisdom, Knowledge, Age"
"Think how different it is to experience a word than a sound. When you're hearing a singer, you're controlled by the words, because you understand the language, you know what they're talking about, and you're forced to think about what they're talking about. But when you're hearing that same thing without a word, you're free to wander.",Jenny Scheinman,"Free, Language, Words"

"I can't control what people think. I'm not trying to manipulate people's thoughts or sentiments. I write all the time. You have to experience life, make observations, and ask questions.

It's a very strange and quite terrifying experience to watch yourself on TV. I never like to do it with other people.,Simon Bird,"Yourself, People, Never"

"The essence of a role-playing game is that it is a group, cooperative experience.",Gary Gygax,"Game, Group, Essence"

This place changed my life. I was transformed by every visit.",Michael Wolff,"Life, Art, Balance"
"I'm not trying to be romantic. I think you can tell when people are trying to be sexy onstage. When I was doing 'All the Way,' I was really thinking about my wife. People don't know my personal experience, but they can tell it's an honest interpretation.","Harry Connick, Jr.","Romantic, Sexy, Wife"
"There is nothing like a live performance. You can look at things on television, and you can look at things on YouTube, but when you get in a room full of people and you say one joke, and everyone's laughing at the same thing, it's a really great experience.",Loni Love,"Great, Look, YouTube"

"We are different, in essence, from other men. If you want to win something, run 100 meters. If you want to experience something, run a marathon.",Emil Zatopek,"Men, Win, Something"
"'Mudbound,' you know, is about home. 'Mudbound' is about what it means to be a citizen, and 'Mudbound,' in fact, is set in this post-reconstruction era that we haven't really explored. You know, not since 'Sounder' have we even really explored that experience.",Dee Rees,"Home, Know, Citizen"
"My experience with 'Transparent' has completely spoiled me because it was the safest, most transpositive set ever.

When they don't know the correct gender pronouns by which to refer to you.",Hari Nef,"Vision, Your, Me"
"The way Everest is guided is very different from the way other mountains are guided, and it flies in the face of values I hold dear: self-reliance, taking responsibility for what you do, making your own decisions, trusting your judgment - the kind of judgment that comes only through paying your dues, through experience.",Jon Krakauer,"Your, Responsibility, Face"
There is no time and space limitation for public accountability on the Internet. Creative commonality is standard and does not resemble the authoritarian style of the dead communist experience.

"I had a really traumatizing experience growing up. When I was, like, 10 or 11, I was vegan. I'm not anymore, but I was, and I went to this hot dog place because I heard they had a veggie dog.

"China's republican politics is like a child who just started schooling. He must have a good teacher and be surrounded by good friends.

"I had a lot of different reasons for writing the book, but at its core was the desire to write for black teenage girls growing up reading books they were absent from.

"Going to a party, for me, is as much a learning experience as, you know, sitting in a lecture.",Natalie Portman,"Learning, New Year's, Me"
"To remember non-attachment is to remember what freedom is all about. If we get attached, even to a beautiful state of being, we are caught, and ultimately we will suffer.

"As the leader of twelve apostles, even Jesus had more executive experience than Obama.",Ann Coulter,"More, Executive, Leader"
"When TV came, people said who will go to theatres to watch movies? When the Internet came, they said the same. And now it's the digital media...

We had an amazing experience shooting the first season of 'Leverage' with such a talented cast and crew and with the full support of TNT behind us.,Dean Devlin,"Amazing, Support, First"
"Much of a poet's experience takes place in imagination only; the life he tells is oftenest the life that he strongly desires to live, and the power, the purity and height of his utterance may not seldom be the greater because experience here uses the voices of desire.",George Edward Woodberry,"Life, Power, Imagination"
"National Parks are a part of the American experience. They evoke memories of childhood vacations and pride in the beauty of our national landscapes.
