"As with the Christian religion, the worst advertisement for Socialism is its adherents.",George Orwell,"Socialism, Worst, Christian"

"We must not confuse religion with God, or technology with science. Religion stands in relationship to God as technology does in relation to science.

I am fascinated in religion and theology and what people believe.,Sarah Wayne Callies,"Believe, I Am, People"
"In 1986, Pakistan got the blasphemy law. So, while we had just two cases of blasphemy before that year, now we have thousands.

"The word 'religion' is only a label. What lies behind that, the most important thing of all, is the word 'faith'.

You're kind of in-between, or you're on the fence.",Ridley Scott,"Faith, Important, Fence"

"I'm not a big fan of religion for that reason. But I am a true believer in God, and I have great faith, and I think that a spiritual connection with something is a really important part of our experience. That doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the church.",Shaun Cassidy,"Faith, God, Experience"

"I left my husband a year after 9/11. Not because he was an American and I an Egyptian, nothing to do with culture or religion, nothing to do with 9/11. We brought out the worst in each other.

"The Islam of the 18th, 19th and first half of the 20th century was a poor thing. Nobody bothered about it. Islam was that funny sort of pure system of beliefs that depressed people in the Middle East held as their religion.",John Keegan,"Funny, Poor, People"

"People can be only divided into good or bad; their race, religion, nationality don't matter.",Irena Sendler,"Good, Matter, Bad"
"I had a somewhat religious upbringing. Not strict, but it was there, and I'm kind of thankful for that.

The first canon of my religion is that you shouldn't try to convince anybody to believe like you do.,Leon Russell,"Believe, Try, First"

"I love the idea of the teachings of Jesus Christ and the beautiful stories about it, which I loved in Sunday school and I collected all the little stickers and put them in my book.

"The humanists' replacement for religion: work really hard and somehow you'll either save yourself or you'll be immortal. Of course, that's a total joke, and our progress is nothing.

"The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important.",Bill Gates,"Important, Moral, Think"
"If one has the answers to all the questions - that is the proof that God is not with him. It means that he is a false prophet using religion for himself.

Freedom of religion does not entitle your religion to have a privileged position within the public sphere.,Gad Saad,"Freedom, Your, Position"
"All these walls that keep us from loving each other as one family or one race - racism, religion, where we grew up, whatever, class, socioeconomic - what makes us be so selfish and prideful, what keeps us from wanting to help the next man, what makes us be so focused on a personal legacy as opposed to the entire legacy of a race.",Kanye West,"Family, Man, Legacy"
"That's what stress management is about, that's what psychotherapy is about, finding religion, or finding your loved one or your hobby - any of those, they give you more outlets, more of a sense of control, more of a sense of predictability, of social support. They give you the means to psychologically finesse ambiguous outside reality.",Robert Sapolsky,"Your, Reality, Stress"
"When you go after someone who has a deep ideological belief set that is contradictory with your own, it's conversion. Conversion is hard. Conversion is miraculous. We have entire religions built around the idea of conversion. Politics is not a religion. Politics is about persuasion.",Stacey Abrams,"Politics, Your, Own"
"When Christians start thinking about Jesus, things start breaking down, they lose their faith. It's perfectly possible to go to church every Sunday and not ask any questions, just because you like it as a way of life.

I think a yogi can do both things quite easily. And I manage to balance both worldly and spiritual concerns.",Yogi Adityanath,"Life, Path, Balance"
"Most modern science fiction went to school on 'Dune.' Even 'Harry Potter' with its 'boy protagonist who has not yet grown into his destiny' shares a common theme.

"Religion enabled society to organise itself to debate goodness, just as Greek drama had once done.",Edward Bond,"Society, Done, Debate"

"Whether one believes in evolution, intelligent design, or Divine Creation, one thing is certain.

And also a possible trap, and I tried to overcome that by portraying it, hopefully, with great nuance and detail and texture.",Sebastian Lelio,"Life, Great, Community"

"If you have a particular faith or religion, that is good. But you can survive without it.",Dalai Lama,"Faith, Good, Survive"

When you see it as a bridge, you aren't so worried about bringing others over to your side.",Keith Ellison,"Faith, God, Path"
"In my view, the Christian religion is the most important and one of the first things in which all children, under a free government ought to be instructed.",Noah Webster,"Government, View, Free"

"Religion and ritual can be vehicles for entering stillness. It says in Psalm 46:10, 'Be still, and know that I am God.' But they are still just vehicles. The Buddha called his teaching a raft: You don't need to carry it around with you after you've crossed the river.",Eckhart Tolle,"God, River, I Am"
"God is so big. It's a gigantic concept in God. The idea that God might love us and be interested in us is kind of huge and gigantic, but we turn it, because we're small-minded, into this tiny, petty, often greedy version of God, that is religion.",Bono,"Love, God, Turn"
"When a person thinks, I am a Christian, this other person is a Muslim, therefore he is my enemy, or I am a Muslim, this other person is a Hindu, therefore she is my enemy, they reveal their own lack of spiritual depth.

I am in no way saying it always relieves any of this!",Alex Gibney,"Dreams, Sports, Always"

I won't take my religion from any man who never works except with his mouth.,Carl Sandburg,"Man, Never, Mouth"
"Christianity is the fastest-growing religion in the world; Islam is the second. It's spreading in Asia, Africa, and South America.

One of the things that is wrong with religion is that it teaches us to be satisfied with answers which are not really answers at all.,Richard Dawkins,"Satisfied, Wrong, Things"

"I think there's an awful lot of noise about the Church being persecuted but there is a more real issue that the conventional churches face - that the people who are really driving their revival and success believe in an old-time religion which, in my view, is incompatible with a modern, multi-ethnic, multicultural society.",Trevor Phillips,"Success, Society, Believe"

"Hobbies of any kind are boring except to people who have the same hobby. This is also true of religion, although you will not find me saying so in print.",Dave Barry,"Me, Boring, Will"

"I think religion is very personal. I definitely identify as Muslim. I consider myself practicing, but I don't think people who observe me from the outside would think of me as devout, and that doesn't bother me because one of the beauties of Islam is the fact that it is personal: you read the Koran, and what you believe is what you believe.",Maysoon Zayid,"Myself, Believe, Me"

Man, like the universe, is a machine.",Nikola Tesla,"Science, Great, Man"
"I'm ready for a Christianity that 'ruins' my life, that captures my heart and makes me uncomfortable.
