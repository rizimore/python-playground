"'Liberal Fascism' is less an expose of left-wing hypocrisy than a chance to exact political revenge.

"A lot of the time, you're supposed to play to the top of your intelligence, as truthful as possible. But when you're on stage making people laugh, you're still acting. I think it helped me a bunch to go on stage two or three times a week.",Ben Schwartz,"Time, Your, Me"
