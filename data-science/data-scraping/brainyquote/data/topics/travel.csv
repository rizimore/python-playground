"No level of border security, no wall, doubling the size of the border patrol, all these things will not stop the illegal migration from countries as long as a 7-year-old is desperate enough to flee on her own and travel the entire length of Mexico because of the poverty and the violence in her country.",Jeh Johnson,"Long, Poverty, Will"
"During their service, men and women in our Armed Forces live by a common creed, promising never to leave a soldier behind. We should live by the same principle.

"Fashion pictures show people looking glamorous. Travel pictures show a place looking at its best, nothing to do with the reality. In the cookery pages, the food always looks amazing, right? Most of the pictures we consume are propaganda.",Martin Parr,"Best, Food, Amazing"

"Every student of science, even if he cannot start his journey where his predecessors left off, can at least travel their beaten track more quickly than they could while they were clearing the way: and so before his race is run, he comes to virgin forest and becomes himself a pioneer.",Theodore William Richards,"Science, Journey, Start"
"Every job has its downside. For example, being in a band; the travel part of it - getting picked up from your house in a car, going to the airport, getting on a plane, going from the airplane to a van, then going from the van to a hotel.",Dave Lombardo,"Car, Your, Airplane"
"I collect travel alarm clocks. I was in a flea market in France once, in 1994, and I opened up this beautiful Jaeger-LeCoultre folding eight-day winding clock folded into a beautiful case, and I went, 'Wow, man.'

"In 1967 I entered Harvard as a freshman, confident - in the way that only 17-year-olds are - that I could change the world.

"I grew up on the lake and spent most of that time outdoors. As a musician, I travel widely around the country and talk to a lot of people, from all walks of life.

In many ways, the environment is also the underdog - so, it's an easy fit.",Gord Downie,"Life, Experience, Time"
"Time travel and teleportation will have to wait. It may take centuries to master these technology.

"If I were involved with the NBA, I wouldn't want a 19-year-old or a 20-year-old kid to bring into all the travel and all the problems that exist in the NBA. I would want a much more mature kid.
