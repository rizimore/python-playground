"You get your heart stomped by the opposite sex, and you're hurting so badly that you write 'Sometimes When We Touch.' But then what happens when you've been married for 25 years?

It would be a bitter cosmic joke if we destroy ourselves due to atrophy of the imagination.,Martha Gellhorn,"Destroy, Joke, Bitter"
"I feel like the Internet needs to be disarmed in some way. There needs to be a philosophical undermining of the Internet. We take it too seriously and too literally.

I never even expected in my wildest of dreams that the film would grow on to become a phenomenon of sorts.",Prabhas,"Work, Dreams, Mind"
"I think artists can influence only through making music that challenges people, excites them and flips them out.

My imagination functions much better when I don't have to speak to people.,Patricia Highsmith,"Better, People, Speak"

"Life-writing calls for any number of dubious gifts: A touch of O.C.D., a lack of imagination, a large desk, neutrality of Swiss proportions, tactlessness, a high tolerance for archival dust.

"I'm a light sleeper. I've never been one of those people who can put their head down and suddenly everything disappears. Nighttime is the time I get most scared, anxious or worried.

"In schools giving students a full education, not to create great artists but about the right to have full expression and imagination and creativity, along with an acknowledgement that everybody learns differently.

"When I was a teenager, reading for me was as normal, as unremarkable as eating or breathing.

"Never, and I mean never, allow anyone else's ideas of who you can or can't become sully your dream or pollute your imagination. This is your territory, and a 'Keep Out' sign is a great thing to erect at all entrances to your imagination.",Wayne Dyer,"Great, Your, Keep"

"Each one seems to be, in some way, essentially different from the others, and each is a surprise to me. I think that making books, or any kind of art, might also be like mining.

"I think my imagination dictates the technologies I use. But at the same time, my imagination can be technologic. Sometimes I see a tool and I know immediately how to use it, but most of the time I use the tool for an idea I already have.",Michel Gondry,"Time, Know, Sometimes"

"No, no, I don't watch football. The last time I tried watching was the last Super Bowl. The problem I have is, you know, the graphic nature of my imagination; when I watch and see them meeting head onto head, helmet onto helmet, what flashes through my mind is what's going on in their brains. It's like torture to me.",Bennet Omalu,"Nature, Time, Football"
"If I feel like I haven't really tapped into the essence of the story when I do an assignment, I may revisit it on my own, and that's when I feel freer to add my imagination.

Sometimes when you've got too much money you lose your imagination.,Paloma Faith,"Money, Your, Lose"

My imagination is my polestar; I steer by that.,Clive Barker,Steer
I suppose I'm proudest of my novels for what's imagined in them. I think the world of my imagination is a richer and more interesting place than my personal biography.,John Irving,"World, Place, Interesting"
"'Super 8' was a lot of fun. It was a lot of fun working with J.J. Abrams, who I think is a kid in a grown man's body, which is a great ingredient for any artist in our business. You have to be a kid at heart to be able to make believe, and his imagination is phenomenal.",Glynn Turman,"Business, Great, Heart"

"There's a particular sensitivity required to be an artist, and a certain vulnerability, perhaps, and also, somewhere between, you're in your body a lot, too.

I do feel the imagination isn't just in the brain up there.",Michael Leunig,"Brain, Your, Body"

"Experience teaches that when the will and imagination are in conflict, the imagination usually wins.

Wirthlin,"Experience, Mind, Body"
The best way to renew thought is to go outside the human imagination.,Bernard Werber,"Best, Way, Human"
"Here is everything which can lay hold of the eye, ear and imagination - everything which can charm and bewitch the simple and ignorant. I wonder how Luther ever broke the spell.",John Adams,"Simple, Everything, Wonder"

"If the history of the western moral imagination is the story of an enduring and unending revolt against human cruelty, there are few more consequential figures than Raphael Lemkin - and few whose achievements have been more ignored by the general public.

"I would love to go back to any time in European history, especially in Irish history, to the second or third century, prior to the arrival of Christianity when Paganism flourished.

P. Lovecraft,"Cats, Must, Like"
"You can have 10 bucks to 10 million bucks and if you got a crew, imagination and a lot of people willing to turn in some work next to nothing, you going to have a feature. But you can't get beyond how expensive marketing the movie is, it's so crushing.",Kevin Smith,"Work, Nothing, People"

"Nonfiction is both easier and harder to write than fiction. It's easier because the facts are already laid out before you, and there is already a narrative arc. What makes it harder is that you are not free to use your imagination and creativity to fill in any missing gaps within the story.",Amy Bloom,"Your, Free, Facts"
"An essay is a thing of the imagination. If there is information in an essay, it is by-the-by, and if there is an opinion, one need not trust it for the long run.

"Imagination, it turns out, is a great deal like reporting in your own head. Here is a paradox of fiction-writing. You are crafting something from nothing, which means, in one sense, that none of it is true. Yet in the writing, and perhaps in the reading, some of a character's actions or lines are truer than others.",Amy Waldman,"Great, Character, Your"
"English is really free for me; there's no limits to the music and the imagination. And French, it's just I live in Paris, and it's really a poetic language where you can really play with words.",Yael Naim,"Music, Me, Free"

"Taking a comic strip character is very hard to write. Because comics are meant to work in one page, to work in frames with minimalistic dialogue. And a lot of it is left to the imagination of the reader. To do that in film, you've got to be a little more explanatory. And that requires a good screenplay and good dialogue.",Ridley Scott,"Work, Good, Character"
You are always drawing from your personal life and using your imagination to fill in the blanks.,Diego Klattenhoff,"Life, Always, Your"

"I was an only child until I was 14, and there were no other kids around the area really. So I spent a lot of time on my own in the fields or by the lake, with just my imagination for company. I suppose I never wanted to let that part of me go.",Jack Reynor,"Time, Me, Own"

"I grew up in the D.C. suburbs, and what I like about that place is that there's not a strong regional affect in the cultural imagination like there is in Dallas or San Francisco or New York City. You have a little more freedom as a novelist this way. The suburbs become a generic idea, and the place doesn't intrude into the narrative.",Rumaan Alam,"Freedom, City, Way"
"I write from my imagination, not from what I've read in books or seen on TV or to make money. I wrote from an idea I was passionate about.",Dirk Benedict,"Money, Make, Seen"

Imagination is a beast that has to be put in a cage.,Timothy Spall,"Beast, Cage, Put"
"When you're even on a regular movie set, you still have to suspend your disbelief.

"I still have a photo on my wall of the greatest idol I will ever have in my life, and it's myself at eight.

When you enter a period of history, your imagination just goes wild in creating the world, which is really what acting is.",Tom Mison,"History, Always, Your"

We are incapable of leaving anything to the imagination and loath to leave anything out. Maniacal thoroughness has become our national verbal ideal.,Florence King,"Anything, Leave, Leaving"
