"I was brought up to believe that it's family first. Of all the people my parents knew, the family was most important. You always turn to your family, and the family supports you.

Live television is the hottest medium. My passion for sports debate runs hot enough without a camera transporting it into your living room with 10 times more impact.,Skip Bayless,"Your, Passion, Debate"
Swimming is probably the ultimate of burnout sports.

"I am very hopeful that my personal success in Qatar will ignite others, especially those in the so-called non-traditional sports, to try even harder because now they can see for themselves that significant achievements can be attained. But let me stress that it takes a lot of work - in fact, very hard work - mixed with very heavy doses of patience.",Alia Atkinson,"Success, Work, Patience"
"I've always been a mediocre student, so I never won an award in school. I'm not very athletic, so I've never won a sports award. So, I'm a mediocre person.",Nicole Byer,"Always, Award, Person"
"Because of the standing in society, because women's basketball does not draw the interest that major professional sports leagues or men's college basketball draw, Geno Auriemma is never going to be recited by the sports fan at-large as the greatest coach in history.",Doris Burke,"Women, History, Society"

"My dad is the reason I actually started watching wrestling. My dad was never big into sports; we were all big into sports as kids, and he'd go to our Little League games or whatever and not really know what was going on, because he didn't know about sports, but he knew about wrestling.",John Cena,"Dad, Know, Never"

"One of the reasons I'm an actor is because I was no physical specimen as a child. I wasn't athletic and didn't have any prowess in that regard.

"My biggest pet peeve are just girls who go to sports bars who have no intention on caring what teams are playing, like they're looking for just a night out. That drives me more crazy than anything else. Like, don't pretend to be a sports fan.",Jerry Ferrara,"Pet, Caring, Me"
Owning a popular sports team is very different than any other type of business. They don't throw parades when Apple has the biggest quarter in corporate history.

You could say I'm the pioneer in the way I have changed some people's perception of not only sports people but of gay men in general.

"My parents were very supportive of my chess. When I got home after a game of chess, having missed school or something, they always made me feel very welcome; I didn't feel guilty at all about pursuing chess with such fervour. They never, for instance, perceived sports as a rival to academics.",Viswanathan Anand,"Home, Always, Welcome"

"When I'm doing sports, I always think of how it's related to singing, and when I watch tennis, I learn a lot for my singing: how the players are focused, how they use their technique, and, in the case of Roger Federer, how effortless it is and how beautiful it is to watch - like bel canto, in a way. That's how singing should be.",Juan Diego Florez,"Beautiful, Always, Doing"
"I always felt second best. I was never the prettiest, never the skinniest, never the fastest in my sports. Never the smartest, because I have dyslexia. Then, all of a sudden, people were like, 'You're gorgeous.' And I was like, 'What?'",Ashley Graham,"Best, Always, People"
"Tribalism, after all, is part of our evolutionary DNA. The need to identify with a group, to belong and commune with like-minded people is not only biological, it's what has helped motivate our desire for and devotion to all kinds of important cultural institutions, from organized religion to sports fandom.",S.E. Cupp,"Religion, Important, People"

"My heroes, I couldn't imagine them practicing. Like Bob Dylan, you know? Bob Dylan's a very, very good guitar player, but it's like he's trying to hide it. I always loved this attitude.

I was a sports nut when I was a kid.",Matt Lauer,"Me, Job, Never"
"I see similarities in the sports I played growing up in the sense of how I tackle a role when I get a job. A lot of effort goes in on an individual basis.
