There's an electrical thing about movies.,Oliver Stone,"Electrical, About, Thing"

"I like happy endings in movies. I think life has a happy ending. When it's all said and done, it's all something worthwhile, and I want my movies to reflect that.

That's why he's a movie star... he's so creative.",Don Rickles,"Name, Dirty, Why"
"There's always room out there for the hand-drawn image. I personally like the imperfection of hand drawing as opposed to the slick look of computer animation. But you can do good stuff either way.

"I want to keep working, I want to keep doing my humanitarian stuff around the world, shining light on different places that have problems. Keep making movies, make people laugh.",Chris Tucker,"Light, World, Problems"
Editing is where movies are made or broken. Many a film has been saved and many a film has been ruined in the editing room.,Joe Dante,"Editing, Broken, Room"
"Talking about dreams is like talking about movies, since the cinema uses the language of dreams; years can pass in a second, and you can hop from one place to another. It's a language made of image. And in the real cinema, every object and every light means something, as in a dream.",Federico Fellini,"Dreams, Light, Cinema"
"Streaming TV shows, movies, and other types of video over the Internet to all manner of devices, once a fringe habit, is now a squarely mainstream practice.

"It would be nice to make a movie that other people want to make, because every one of these movies, I basically have to find the only company in the world that's willing to make it, and it's always a big challenge. I end up spending a tremendous amount of energy and time trying to get money to make these movies and it's exhausting.",Darren Aronofsky,"Time, Money, Always"

When I go to movies I generally want to be taken to another world.,Darren Aronofsky,"World, Go, Want"
"Our lives are pretty calm. Merging on the freeway in the closest you get to risking your life. So what's missing now is that primal emotion of being scared to death, and I think that's why people crave thrills like roller coasters or scary movies. They give you the chance to feel this very primal emotion in a very controlled environment.",Oren Peli,"Life, Death, Chance"
"In the movies, every crazy old fart needs a cool old car. Jack Nicholson drove a spiffy yellow 1970 Dodge Challenger two-door in 'The Bucket List.' In 'Gran Torino,' the cranky pensioner played by Clint Eastwood not only owned a 1972 GT Sport, he also used to build cars like that at the Ford plant.",Richard Corliss,"Cool, Car, Plant"
"I was a strange, dark little dude. I fell in love with horror movies, at a very early age.

"When I was in high school, there was 'Superbad' and 'The Girl Next Door' and 'Wedding Crashers' and all these great movies.

You may have seen me in movies like 'Fast & Furious' and 'Avatar.' But I wouldn't have been able to do any of that without hard work and determination. You can accomplish anything if you just stay out of trouble and do the right things.,Laz Alonso,"Work, Hard Work, Determination"
"Hollywood is a roulette wheel. Each project dictates what's going to happen for you next, and it doesn't really matter that your project is critically acclaimed or won awards or has fans worldwide.

Also, it's incredibly romantic.",Christina Ricci,"Life, Love, Romantic"
"I've made movies that I thought were good. I've made movies that I thought were okay, but then I was very good.

But that's show business.",Christopher Walken,"Good, Business, Lost"

"Because I was in the business of translating the 'X-Men' from the very successful comics, and taking the most popular book of the 20th century in 'The Lord of the Rings,' and making it into three movies, I hope people realize I wouldn't get involved in anything I didn't think was really going to be worth their while.",Ian Mckellen,"Hope, Business, People"

"Critics can say what they like about the films, but very often, there's a certain expectation of documentaries that they're supposed to be like PowerPoint presentations.

If you care about the character you'll care about the scare.",Mike Flanagan,"Best, Character, Silence"
"If you want to be an actor, you must have total, ruthless commitment to your art. Don't be ambitious for fame or TV or movies. Art is a jealous mistress and will brook no competitors.

There's nothing more important in making movies than the screenplay.,Richard Attenborough,"Nothing, Important, More"
"Movies, to a large extent, stand or fall on the strength of their scripts.

"I tend to detach myself from movies once I'm done shooting them, because after that, it's in the hands of God. And it doesn't help if I panic.",Shruti Haasan,"God, Myself, Done"

"My dad, who is a screenwriter, showed me all these great movies. He showed me 'E.T.' when I was 2-years-old, and I just kind of progressed from there. It was also my brother. We'd always watch movies together, and he'd do these voices and he'd always want to do skits and he'd come up with stuff with me.",Finn Wolfhard,"Great, Dad, Always"

"Yoga did not just help me with my body, I became fitter from within. It helped me to focus better. In the movies, we may look very glamourous and fit, but believe me, not many of us are actually fit from within. Yoga has helped me achieve that.",Shilpa Shetty,"Believe, Focus, Body"

"He was a very strict father, which in a way has helped me to become who I am today. He never pampered me, as he wanted me to live a normal life. No film magazines were allowed at home, and we weren't allowed to watch any movies.",Ram Charan,"Life, Home, Today"

"Music is fun, but I'm an ice skater. I may sing songs and do shows, make movies and other things... that's all well and good and I enjoy it, and I would never trade any of those for anything. But figure skating is who I am.",Johnny Weir,"Good, Music, I Am"
"It's just cool for a girl to be able to do her own thing. I do a lot of movies, and I'm very lucky, and I'm not complaining. But in movies, alongside big action men, we've always got to take a step back and let the men shine.",Maggie Q,"Cool, Men, Always"
"I like movies, because it's kind of a combination of every art, it's like it's picture, it's story, it's music, it's kind of like a clash and a collide of every art. It's really neat.",Jonathan Jackson,"Art, Music, Picture"
"I get star-struck anytime I meet performers that I grew up watching and appreciating. I mean, it's still incredibly surreal to me that I was a kid in San Antonio watching movies and then now I'm working with some of the people that were in those movies. I don't think it'll ever stop being surreal on some level.",James Roday,"Me, People, Stop"
"I feel that, historically, the Art Deco period has the most resonance for me. As a person, it has to be the plucky Clara Bow, the heroine of American silent movies of the 1920s.

I have a shot a lot of movies in Dubai.,Mohanlal,"Dubai, Shot, Lot"

"Sexiness, particularly in movies, is the chess game in the 'Thomas Crown Affair'. It's, it's, I don't know, but Faye Dunaway comes up a lot in that thinking. It's the subtlety of sexiness. The moment you try to be sexy, then it's not.",Daniel Craig,"Sexy, Moment, Game"
"I was a big fan of martial arts movies - Bruce Lee in particular, as cringeworthy as it is. Jean-Claude van Damme was a big inspiration as well - it's a little embarrassing.",Michael Bisping,"Big Fan, Well, Big"
"I watch other wrestlers. I watch movies with Jackie Chan and Jet Li and Tony Jaa. Then there's breakdancing and Capoeira - just anything I see that looks awesome that I think I could adapt in the ring. Just your typical Kung Fu, breakdancing, Capoeira moves.",John Morrison,"Your, Ring, See"

"If you're strutting around Beverly Hills and hitting up these big industry parties every night when you're not making movies, then it's going to eventually consume you.

"There is a heavy Mexican Catholic streak in my movies, and a huge Mexican sense of melodrama. Everything is overwrought, and there's a sense of acceptance of the fantastic in my films, which is innately Mexican. So when people ask, 'How can you define the Mexican-ness of your films?' I go, 'How can I not?' It's all I am.",Guillermo del Toro,"Your, I Am, Acceptance"
"I wanna do movies that in ten years time people will respect me for, as an actor.

"I just went to your typical public schools, and my dad would take us to the movies every week, or he'd buy scalped tickets to San Antonio Spurs games.

"When I was younger I didn't really know what a director did: I knew I loved movies and I figured the actors made it up!

"I'm carded for R-rated movies. And I get talked down to a lot. When I try to go rent a car or buy an airplane ticket or other stuff adults do, I get 'Okaaaaaay, honey.' I remember when I was 18, getting crayons in a restaurant.",Kristen Bell,"Car, Remember, Restaurant"

"I don't believe in the so-called Latino explosion when it comes to movies. Jennifer Lopez doesn't have an accent. She grew up in New York speaking English, not Spanish.

"If you look at my movies, they're pretty densely packed, such that they not only hold up to a second viewing, they're oftentimes better the second time you watch them. So I've always thought about crafting stories that could hold up to multiple viewings, and so VR obviously fits right into that.",Doug Liman,"Time, Always, Better"

"Sometimes I have a melody in my head; sometimes it's just a verse. I read lines from a book or movies that I watch and grab a few quotes and start writing on paper. From there, I record a really rough version and work on the song.",Yuna,"Work, Song, Start"

"Cell phones tend to bring us more inside of our lives whereas movies offer a chance to escape, so there are two competing forces.",Steven Spielberg,"Chance, Escape, Us"
What people adore about superhero movies is the signal quality of the Christopher Nolan films - their complete lack of irony when it comes to the portrayal of heroism and the need for heroes to confront evil.,John Podhoretz,"Quality, Evil, People"
"Hollywood, we get it. The Christian faith just doesn't work for you 'in the long run.' However, for a large percentage of this country (the same country that makes your movies millions of dollars), it does. So please, for all of our sakes, keep your 'beliefs to yourself' and just 'stop the hate.'",Steven Crowder,"Work, Faith, Hate"
"Honestly, not being evasive, but the great thing about Bond is that I have fifty years of movies - 23 movies and all the Ian Fleming novels and short stories, all of which are fodder.

"Even when I was a little kid, I always said I would be in the movies one day, and damned if I didn't make it.",Richard Pryor,"Always, Day, Make"
"Jason Voorhees was a kid who was picked on at summer camp, and Michael Myers was someone vilified by his own family. I think that's why gay people like horror movies, because it's seeking revenge on the privileged.",Sharon Needles,"Family, Revenge, Gay"
"As a kid, my idols were Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson, and I get into crazy races with myself. Raimi was 21 when he made movies, and when I didn't get 'Cabin Fever' made that fast I thought I'd failed.",Eli Roth,"Myself, Crazy, Fast"
"When the Beatles came in, I really concentrated on making a lot of movies. Those beach films that we did were a lot fun. They hit with an audience that related to what we were trying to do on the screen. That kept me going all through that Beatle period.",Frankie Avalon,"Me, Trying, Fun"
"I'm a big movie fan, and I want to make movies in every genre. I want to make my romantic comedy one day.",James Wan,"Romantic, Day, Comedy"

I'm not a film buff. I don't watch a lot of movies.,Denzel Washington,"Watch, Film, Buff"
"I think all of us, under certain circumstances, could be capable of some very despicable acts.

I am a big fan of movies from the '70s.,Chris Messina,"I Am, Big Fan, Big"

I wanted to do another movie that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world. I wanted to do something else that could make us smile. This is a time when we need to smile more and Hollywood movies are supposed to do that for people in difficult times.,Steven Spielberg,"Smile, Good, Time"

"I like Hindi movies. Although my wife thinks the hero and heroine breaking into a song and dance every five minutes is ridiculous, but I find them entertaining.",Anish Giri,"Hero, Wife, Song"
"We've been shooting the last two weeks with a lot of vampires. I don't want to give away too much, but if you've read the books, it's the standoff with lots of vampires in play. There's like 70 people going through the works at once. It's a little maddening, but fun. We shot pretty much the ending of the two movies the other day.",Peter Facinelli,"Day, Ending, People"
"I've managed to do movies and still keep a lifestyle where I can go to ballgames, go to a grocery store like everybody else.",Chris Evans,"Keep, Lifestyle, I Can"

"When I was a kid, I was in all 'The Mighty Ducks' movies, and that sort of created this weird thing when I was very young.

"I was in 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,' and I like my bad boy movie movies.",Trudie Styler,"Smoking, Bad Boy, Bad"

"It seems to me that one thing people do over and over again is try to figure out how to get married, stay married, fall in love, how to rekindle all this stuff. It seems to me to be a pretty eternal theme so I don't know if you can get typecast from making movies about men relating to women. It seems to be what is going on on the planet a lot.",John Cusack,"Love, Women, Men"
"When I was in 'Billy,' I always knew that I wanted to do something in performing. I always knew that I wanted to have a future in the performing arts. I had no idea that it was going to be acting in movies.",Tom Holland,"Future, Always, Acting"
"When TV came, people said who will go to theatres to watch movies? When the Internet came, they said the same. And now it's the digital media...

"The comic is today's western, so many movies, and I think that if actors want to optimize their longevity, it's important for them to meet the fans because those fans are so loyal and will show up at any movie or tune in to any television show they're on.",Erin Gray,"Today, Will, Important"

Billions of people have seen and been influenced by movies in the short history of this industry.,Conrad Hall,"History, People, Short"
"In the 1950s, we had all these B-grade science-fiction movies. The point was to scare the public and get them to buy popcorn. No attempt was made to create movies that were somewhat inherent to the truth.",Michio Kaku,"Truth, Create, Point"

"Obviously 'Pete's Dragon' is more commercial than 'A Ghost Story,' but when making them, I'm just trying to tell a story that matters to me, that ultimately would satisfy me as a moviegoer. Because watching movies is my favorite thing to do. I watch a lot of them.",David Lowery,"Me, Trying, Story"
"Had I not done Shakespeare, Pinter, Moliere and things such as 'Godspell' - I played Judas in a hugely successful production before I did 'Elm Street' - I'd probably be on a psychiatrist's couch saying: 'Freddy ruined me.'

I'm a great consumer of kung-fu movies - mid-'70s to late-'80s.,Keegan-Michael Key,"Great, Consumer"

"When I was a kid, I thought movies just came from air. I thought they just appeared.",Clint Eastwood,"Air, Thought, Just"
"The problem with my mind is it sways from side to side. The idea of me fantasizing about becoming an actor quickly led to depression. 'No, it was never going to happen to me.' I was a sixteen-year-old kid on the other side of the world from where they made movies. Scottish actors never really got play. There was Sean Connery, and that was it.",Gerard Butler,"Mind, World, Me"
"I'm an enormous admirer of Christopher Lee. He's somebody, along with Vincent Price, who I celebrate, and I wanted my movies to show that celebration and that honoring of these great film stars that were unafraid to go into horror and Grand Guignol and the macabre.",Nicolas Cage,"Great, Celebrate, Stars"
"'In A World...' changed my life a thousand per cent. I feel thankful that something I believed in so much - I love dialect, so I dedicated five years of my life to making a film about it - yielded such rewards. It led to 'Man Up,' as well as 'No Escape,' which comes out later this year... two movies where I am the female lead.",Lake Bell,"Life, Love, Thankful"
"I don't know if I'd want to be a Secret Service agent. In the movies, it's exciting and romantic and all that. Really, most of their job is standing in a hallway for 12 hours making sure somebody doesn't come through a doorway off of a stairwell.",Dennis Quaid,"Romantic, Service, Know"
"There's no reason my films can't work as hard as VR does to hook an audience and never let them go, so I think that that it turns the volume up a little bit on storytelling. The same way when I was doing commercials and then I went and shot 'Go,' and 'Go' has a level of pace that is unlike any of my other movies.",Doug Liman,"Work, Doing, Way"
"Life is never all one thing. It bounces around. Certainly, my own life has. Look at Woody Allen's funny movies - all the humor comes out of sad stuff. Sometimes you have to laugh, no matter what life deals you.",Tim O'Brien,"Life, Funny, Sad"

"Sure, you can do something frothy and ridiculous, but you should probably be confident that it's going to be a sure-fire hit. Then it's sensible, because it enables you to make smaller movies. But if you make something frothy and ridiculous that doesn't work, it's not worth it.",Paul Bettany,"Work, Ridiculous, Make"
"When I started in movies, they said I'd be this big star, but I was only a moderate one. Not enough good pictures. It's important to be in a good piece of work no matter the size of one's own part.",Suzanne Pleshette,"Work, Good, Matter"
"My children have never watched any of my films. Charlie knows that daddy makes movies, but he says they are not good enough for him to watch.",Russell Crowe,"Good, Enough, Children"
"I've been naked in a lot of my movies. There's something inherently funny about the naked male body, particularly mine.",Paul Rudd,"Funny, Body, Naked"
"When I'm doing a movie, I'm not doing anything else. It's all about the movie. I don't have a wife. I don't have a kid. Nothing can get in my way... I've made a choice, so far, to go on this road alone. Because this is my time. This is my time to make movies.",Quentin Tarantino,"Alone, Time, Wife"
"Life is short. I'm 47 years old. I've got 10 years to go where I can be the best I can be. I want those 10 years to be precious, not like before, cranking two or three movies a year. I've made a ton of movies in my life, but so what?",Jean-Claude Van Damme,"Life, Best, Life Is Short"
"It goes back to a style of moviemaking I remember seeing as a child, in movies like The Man With The Golden Arm, which I think was shot all on a sound stage.",Debbie Allen,"Man, Remember, Style"
"Honestly, I'm not a big movie buff in general. The only movies I own is probably the 'Indiana Jones' trilogy.",Miles Teller,"Own, Big, Only"

I don't want to produce anymore small or independent movies because it's just too hard these days.,John Cusack,"Hard, Independent, Small"
"I have a lot of Chinese fans who buy my movies on the street and watch them, and I'm OK with it. I'm not OK with it in other places, but if the government's going to censor me, then I want the people to see it in any way they can.",Quentin Tarantino,"Government, Me, Street"
"There's no reason to think Disney is going to stop wanting to make 'Star Wars' movies if there's quality and there's interest. It has unlimited potential. It has a huge number of characters, worlds... It's a massive playground.",John Knoll,"Quality, Reason, Stop"
"In the '50s, audiences accepted a level of artifice that the audiences in 1966 would chuckle at. And the audiences of 1978 would chuckle at what the audience of 1966 said was okay, too. The trick is to try to be way ahead of that curve, so they're not chuckling at your movies 20 years down the line.",Quentin Tarantino,"Your, Try, Way"
The success of the storytellers - we're only as good as what we can withhold from the audience. Aspects of surprise and letting things play out for the audience - it's so much a part of their enjoyment. It's one of the great things about working in the movies and being a great storyteller.,B. D. Wong,"Success, Good, Great"
"With bad movies, I have this image in my head of the director and the editor in the editing room watching a scene that is not happening, looking at each other and saying, 'Put some music in there.'",Gustavo Santaolalla,"Music, Editing, Bad"
"Movies for adults sucked in the 1980s, and music for adults sucked even worse; whether we're talking about Kathleen Turner flicks or Sting albums, the decade's non-teen culture has no staying power at all.",Rob Sheffield,"Power, Music, Culture"
"I'm pretty upfront about my love and admiration for the military. One of the perks of making movies is that you get to sort of follow your own passions, and I believe quite passionately that we don't pay enough attention and respect to our veterans.

"Sex is a doorway to something so powerful and mystical, but movies usually depict it in a completely flat way.",David Lynch,"Sex, Way, Something"

"I love movies that make me cry, because they're tapping into a real emotion in me, and I always think afterwards: how did they do that?",John Lasseter,"Love, Always, Me"
"The greats are 'The Shining', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'Don't Look Now', 'The Exorcist' - those movies were not really slashers: they were about psychological terror and had very deep emotional backdrops. If we do our best, '6 Miranda Drive' can be that kind of a movie.",Kevin Bacon,"Best, Look, Drive"
"Harvard's Kennedy School of Government asked me to serve as a fellow at its Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy. After my varied and celebrated career in television, movies, publishing, and the lucrative world of corporate speaking, being a fellow at Harvard seemed, frankly, like a step down.",Al Franken,"Politics, Government, Step"

I was fortunate to write pretty much a year out of film school and start making movies in the Hollywood studio system. But with each progressive film it became more frustrating not being able to speak and say things I wanted to say.,Rick Famuyiwa,"Start, Speak, School"
"With any of the movies I've had a chance to do, or any of the TV shows I've had a chance to contribute to, people approach me and say, 'Hey, would you like to do this?' I laugh out loud and say, 'Yes, that'd be funny.' Or, I'm very moved by what I read and say, 'Yes. How can I help you?'",John Cena,"Funny, Chance, Me"
There are a lot of movies that are unbelievable successes that I would be mortified to be a part of.,Jennifer Aniston,"Would, Unbelievable, Lot"

I want to make movies and pieces of television and pieces of art that crack everyone's assumptions.,Keegan-Michael Key,"Art, Assumptions, Everyone"
I really spent most of my childhood in my bedroom watching Barbra Streisand movies and musicals and making videos. That was kind of where it all started for me. I would go to the beach occasionally.,Randy Rainbow,"Childhood, Me, Bedroom"

I only make movies to finance my fishing.,Lee Marvin,"Finance, Fishing, Make"
"But I like schlocky violent movies, but I'm for strict gun control. But then there was a time I was at a laser tag place, and I had such a good time hiding in a corner shooting at people. In other words, I'm your basic confused human when it comes to violence.",Robert Sapolsky,"Good, Time, Your"
"My choices in projects have all been character or role-based, and on a financial level, it's obvious: as an actor on a TV series, I get a wonderful paycheck, and a consistent paycheck, which doesn't always happen when you're doing theater or movies.",Jim Parsons,"Always, Character, Doing"
"I don't like excessive violence. That's my thing. I don't like movies heavy with guns, any of that stuff, so I'm not into that stuff, but I love a psychological thriller.",Diana Silvers,"Love, Guns, Violence"

"I just hope, every now and then, the studios still slip one of my movies in.",John Lee Hancock,"Hope, Now And Then, Now"
It's a big criticism of Greenaway films that they are far too interested in formalism and not enough interested in notions of emotional content.

"In my formative years, I never missed the 'Creature Double Feature' on Saturday afternoon TV, even if it meant switching back and forth between 'Gamera' and the Red Sox.

"I never got in this business, in cinema, to make horror movies. They arrived on my doorstep and I got typecast. Which was fine, I enjoy it, but I got into this business to make westerns. And the kind of westerns I used to see, they died. So that didn't work out.",John Carpenter,"Work, Business, Cinema"
"When I was a kid, I loved action, war, horror, monster movies... Anything with special effects. I was fascinated with how'd they do that.",Robert Zemeckis,"War, Action, Anything"
"I really love the independent movies and I just think that sometimes when they throw a lot of money into it and a lot of special effects and a lot of stunts that you lose the connection, the human connection and I personally love movies that are about the human connection.",Jane Seymour,"Love, Money, Lose"
"There are some movies that I would like to forget, for the rest of my life - really! But even those movies that I'd like to forget teach me things.",Antonio Banderas,"Life, Rest, Me"
"I like zombie movies, and I like genre movies a lot. To watch. Less so to make, I think. But I grew up on that stuff. I would just grow up watching a lot of horror movies, a lot of slasher movies and then zombie movies.",Jonathan Levine,"Grow, Watching, Make"
"Just because there are celebrities in a movie, it doesn't mean anything. I don't think The Ant Bully did all that well the first week at the box office. Compare the movies that have a lot of celebrities with the Jimmy Neutron movie, which had no celebrity voices and grossed almost one hundred million dollars.",Rob Paulsen,"Just Because, First, Week"
I've done movies with a sword before. But I haven't really been given the full responsibility of something like a Ridley Scott film.,Orlando Bloom,"Done, Responsibility, Sword"
"I've never seen 'The Goonies.' I've never seen 'Indiana Jones.' I watched 'UHF' over and over again when I was little, and that was it. I had no time for any other movies. I watched 'Naked Gun,' 'UHF,' and 'Airplane!' over and over.",Eric Andre,"Time, Gun, Airplane"
"I was an only child. I needed an alternative to family life - to real life, you could almost say - and cartoons, pictures in a book, the animated movies, seemed to provide it.",John Updike,"Life, Family, Real"
'The Princess Bride' is one of my favorite movies of all time.,Ivana Milicevic,"Time, Bride, Princess"
"Bergman movies were the most influential. They used to show at Goucher University, which was where my parents used to live. 'Brink of Life' was the first one I ever saw. Three pregnant women in a maternity ward and their misery - I love that. That is what I want to show at my funeral.",John Waters,"Life, Love, Women"
"My mother was keen that I complete my graduation and never ever wanted me to be in the movies, as my father had made five films that lost money. One of the films he made was 'Agneepath,' which was hugely hyped but underwhelming at the box office, and I remember that my dad had to sell my grandmother's flat to pay off the loan.",Karan Johar,"Money, Dad, Graduation"
"I like to be someone else. I like to be someone other than myself. I grew up watching movies and being a fan of what I'd seen portrayed in the movies, and I always wanted to do that one day.",Quinton Aaron,"Myself, Always, Day"
"I loved cowboy movies when I was a kid. When I was five years old, I was already wearing a cowboy hat and suit. When I grew up, I knew John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Kirk Douglas and so on.",Jackie Chan,"Hat, Old, Loved"
The action movies changed radically when it became possible to Velcro your muscles on. It was the beginning of a new era. The visual took over. The special effects became more important than the single person. That was the beginning of the end.,Sylvester Stallone,"Your, Beginning, New"
"There's always been a little bit of tension between the writers of science fiction literature and then science-fiction televised shows or movies, partly because they have a different dynamic.",John Scalzi,"Science, Always, Science Fiction"
Our job with Thanos is to make him the preeminent villain in the Marvel Universe. That is his role in the comics. That's his role in these movies.,Joe Russo,"Universe, Villain, Job"
"There are so many great actors, but I really have a lot of respect for Johnny Depp. I've seen a lot of movies with him in it and, even if it's a film that wasn't as successful as you thought it would be, I've never seen him put in a bad performance. My favorite actors from history have to be Steve McQueen and James Dean.",Ed Speleers,"History, Respect, Great"
"As an actor, the ambition is to play interesting characters. And in the indie genre world, the budgets are low. That allows me, as an actor, not to have a financial value behind my name, to justify me being in these bigger parts for these types of movies.",A. J. Bowen,"Value, World, Ambition"
"I was a history major, but that was because it took the fewest requirements of any major. In my sophomore year, I started getting back into making movies. My senior year, I took playwriting classes, and I feel like that's where I learned to be a writer.",John Hamburg,"History, Feel, Back"
"Obviously, CGI in the last ten years has gone through such leaps and bounds that today, people are looking for these kinds of movies to wow audiences with technology.",Avi Arad,"Technology, Today, People"
"Prior to having my first child, I had a huge ambition to go into movies and TV.",Vanna White,"Ambition, First Child, First"
"For whatever reason, I think we have one type of animated movie and it's so wrong. I want to do a drama, I want to do an action, a comedy. In live-action, there are all sorts of movies. There's independent movies, big movies, action movies, funny movies, and for us we have one movie.",Genndy Tartakovsky,"Funny, Action, Comedy"
I've never understood the cult of Hitchcock. Particularly the late American movies... Egotism and laziness. And they're all lit like television shows.,Orson Welles,"Late, Laziness, Never"
"'Little Miss Sunshine' snowballed. It was a tiny movie. We shot it in 30 days, and it was really fun to do, but it was one of those small movies that you don't hold out huge hope for.",Greg Kinnear,"Hope, Sunshine, Fun"
"Film buffs who don't live in Hollywood have a fantasy about what it's like to be a director. Movies and the people who make movies have such glamour associated with them. But the truth is, it's not like that. It's very different. It's hard work.",John Carpenter,"Work, Truth, Hard Work"
"There's something strange about theater. My characters consistently demonize elitism, but of course it's taking place in a theater where only so many people can see it. I've been in silly popcorn movies - the kind of thing that as an actor you might feel embarrassed about - but those movies reach many more people.",Jesse Eisenberg,"Feel, People, Place"
"In all my work, in the movies I write, the lyrics, the poetry, the prose, the essays, I am saying that we may encounter many defeats - maybe it's imperative that we encounter the defeats - but we are much stronger than we appear to be and maybe much better than we allow ourselves to be. Human beings are more alike than unalike.",Maya Angelou,"Work, Poetry, Better"
"Watching movies in the U.S. is great fun because they get every joke, they smile, they laugh so much; it's a great feeling.",Jet Li,"Smile, Great, Laugh"
"What I look for in a script is the plot point and whether they're strong, obviously, or not, whether the characters are rich or not, and if I can do justice to the character or not. Some movies you look at and the script is so bad that no one can do anything with the script.",Larenz Tate,"Character, Justice, Look"
"Movies make teenagers have quippy answers for every question. Nothing seems to faze them, and they're like, 'Oh, whatever.' You're not like that when you're a teenager. You're really earnest. Things really feel like life or death. And you kind of oscillate between emotions at one time. It's very emotionally draining being a teenager.",Bel Powley,"Life, Death, Time"
"I read 'Tiger Beat' and 'Bop' from the time I was 9, 10, 11 years old. I loved movies. I saw 'E.T.' seven times. I used to yell at people who called me when 'L.A. Law' was on because they should know better. So I just have been so in love with the business of Hollywood since I can remember.",Julie Plec,"Love, Time, Business"
"Movies are boring. It's like watching paint dry. I did a little role in a movie, and it was eight lines. I was there for three days. It's just horrible. Television is 15 hour days. Movies are 18 hour days. And it's 18 hours of doing not a thing.",Ron White,"Boring, Doing, Watching"
"People ask me about 'The Hurt Locker' a lot, and it's an incredible piece of filmmaking - as are 'Band of Brothers' and 'Platoon' and 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'Apocalypse Now.' But they're not necessarily true to war in a literal sense. What they are, really, are brilliant movies about Hollywood's idea of war.",Sebastian Junger,"War, Me, True"
"This social media era is giving us a more in-depth look at our favorite people, and it's all aspects, from music to movies to television to sports. I think it has been somewhat of a distraction at times, but also a huge benefit.",Matt Barnes,"Sports, Music, Social Media"
"You know how I came up with the name 'Road to the Super Bowl?' It's an homage to the old Bob Hope - Bing Crosby buddy movies - you know, like 'Road to Zanzibar' or 'Road to Morocco.' Can you tell? All I've done my whole life is go to movies.",Steve Sabol,"Life, Hope, Done"
"For some reason and I don't know why, but I don't think that I'm funny in California. So I always want to do my movies east somewhere.",Kevin James,"Funny, Always, Know"
"I would love to go into musicals. I got a chance to sing in 'Big Momma's House,' and that's something I would love to do more. But only in Broadway or in the movies. I don't think I would ever seek a career as a singer.",Jessica Lucas,"Love, Chance, Go"
"What's happening to me is I'm still happy and functioning, being able to listen to music, see good movies, read good books. What else is there that I can't, you know, I mean, I'm OK.",Teri Garr,"Good, Music, Me"
"American movies and music deliver themes of freedom, innocence, and power that appeal to others - partly because America itself was put together out of a multiplicity of national traditions.",Todd Gitlin,"Freedom, Power, Music"
"I'll go to the movies and hear 'Angel From Montgomery' in some film, and nobody ever even told me about it. They don't tell you your stuff is going to be in a movie. They don't have to, so they don't tell you. You get paid eventually.",John Prine,"Angel, Your, Me"
"Movies are such an integral part of American culture. We're so spread out in this country, and movies offer us a chance to come together and have a communal experience.",David Call,"Experience, Chance, Culture"
"During a movie, you lose all ability to focus on your own interests. Your life is in service. After that you just want to disappear, switch off the phone, and sleep and watch movies for a month.",Robert Richardson,"Life, Your, Service"
"Once I had seen 'Journey to Italy,' I knew that, even if I were never to make movies, I could make them.",Jean-Luc Godard,"Journey, Never, Make"

"I'm 6-foot-4 and 240 pounds, which is average size in WWE, but in the world of television and movies, it's huge.",Edge,"World, Television, Size"
"I hate Bollywood. The movies are all garbage, just terrible. It's my opinion; obviously, there are billions who like and love them. I don't like all the singing, dancing and all the dramatic crying. I have never seen a Bollywood film in my life.",Russell Peters,"Life, Love, Hate"
"My dad is a screenwriter, so he always used to watch movies for inspiration when I was a baby. I would watch movies with him, I guess, in the background.",Finn Wolfhard,"Dad, Always, Guess"
"I think whether you're a movie critic and have seen a million movies, or you're just a normal popcorn movie watcher, you can tell the difference when someone is just laying it on too thick.",Josh Peck,"Someone, Difference, Normal"
"As a kid growing up, I really hated being alone. I was always that kid that was like, 'Do you want to hang out? Let's go to the mall. Let's go to the movies. Let's go to the park.' I would call people and call people and call people. If I was alone when I wasn't at school, then there was something wrong.",Jonathan Van Ness,"Alone, Always, People"
"During the off-season I like to travel, go places and learn different cultures. But during the season it's a lot of shows, movies and sleep.",Danny Green,"Travel, Sleep, Go"
"I've started movies without screenplays both on 'Clash' and on 'Hulk,' and that is tremendously stressful because you have a tendency to overcompensate with effects. You haven't tested it in your head. You didn't run it over and over again and covered all of the plot holes and figure it out. It's a marathon that you sprint.",Louis Leterrier,"Your, Head, Without"
"Growing up, I never thought about becoming an actress because I never saw deaf people in TV or movies. I didn't think it was possible.",Millicent Simmonds,"People, Possible, Never"

I love sports and I love sports movies.,James Van Der Beek,"Love, Sports, I Love"
"I feel that in horror movies, especially, if you don't care about the characters, you've lost the audience. No one cares, and it becomes a process of watching people get killed.",Drew Goddard,"Process, Lost, Care"
Live theater to me is much more free than the movies or television.,Eartha Kitt,"Me, Free, Live"
Probably having fallen in love with music and movies at a young age and then first learning about writing by kind of following the path of writers like Dave Marsh and Lester Bangs and being a rock journalist.,Cameron Crowe,"Love, Learning, Age"
"With movies, depending on who your director is or what kind of movie you're shooting, you kind of have more of an ability to play around with the material, go off the page, improv. It's like we did with '21 And Over.' Same thing we did in 'Walk Of Shame.' Same thing we did in 'House Bunny.' You have the freedom to do that.",Sarah Wright,"Freedom, Walk, Your"
"The child stars who emerged from Disney boot camp and dominated pop culture in the late '90s and '00s are not only still around but also have spawned successors who have proven even more indispensable to the business of music, movies, and television.",Tom Junod,"Business, Music, Culture"
"There will always be a slight difference between the reel and the real. Even my family might know 99 per cent about me, but there will be this one per cent about me that nobody will ever know. Being in this profession, I am fine with biopics or movies inspired by real-life-characters.",Vidya Balan,"Family, Always, I Am"
"I started watching so many different types of women, saw all the complexities of them, all the ways and the look and shapes they could be, and I felt it was missing for me in American film. I didn't see anybody I was watching in movies that felt like me. I felt rather tortured and lonely about it.",Brie Larson,"Women, Me, Look"
"My first movie was 'The Mask Of Zorro,' and that was all swords and horses and swashbuckling, and I thought, 'This is what movies are.' Obviously, I never made another one like that again; those are very rare.",Matt Letscher,"Mask, Never, First"

'Clash Of The Titans' is one of the biggest movies I've done; it was certainly the most effects I've worked with.,Mads Mikkelsen,"Done, Most, Titans"
"I've done a lot of dramedies in my career. You know, I started as a standup comic, and then the movies that I was doing, like 'Up Side of Anger' were kind of like - they're hard. They're hard to sell; they're hard to get made, you know.",Mike Binder,"Anger, Done, Doing"
I just love being on a movie set. I like making movies.,Richard Linklater,"Love, Being, Like"

"I didn't go to many movies. My mom would make a family outing and bring chicken in the theater. Smell up the whole place. The most impactful movies were 'Godfather II' and 'Scarface'. I loved the human complexity, and those movies are so well shot. Cinematic greatness. I really stopped going in my early twenties.",Jay-Z,"Family, Mom, Chicken"
"Sometimes I make very selfish choices; like I did 'Once Upon A Time' for my inner 8-year-old and my hypothetical future child. I've done some movies because I would regret them if I didn't, but other projects I've done because they've scared me or if I felt I needed to do a big romantic comedy to help me professionally.",Ginnifer Goodwin,"Future, Time, Romantic"
"For me, Santa was white, and he was in Coca Cola commercials. You never saw a black Santa on TV and in movies, and when you did, it was usually a bum with a Santa hat, or a bunch of jewelry.",Baron Davis,"Hat, Me, Black"
"I think that's what distinguishes Schmidt, really. In the movies now, so much of what is appealing to an audience is the dramatic or has to do with science fiction, and Schmidt is simply human. There's no melodrama; there's no device, It's just about a human being.",Jack Nicholson,"Science, Science Fiction, Human"
"When I was growing up, the top movies dealt with grown-up, complex emotions.",John Slattery,"Emotions, Growing Up, Complex"

"'Ernest Borgnine' is sort of my version of Woody Allen's 'Purple Rose Of Cairo' in that it's about the occasional difficulty of coming to terms with the cold hard facts and the temptation to escape into another world - like movies, for example.

Some movies to me are like vampires - they suck all of the energy out of me and I don't like that. I like to give the audience energy if I can.,Sam Raimi,"Energy, Me, I Can"
"My role models are Madhuri Dixit and Kajol. Both actresses have done a wide variety of roles. That is something I wish to do. On the other hand, I also want to be like a Hugh Jackman or an Angelina Jolie because of the lives they have outside movies. Because of the kind of balance they strike between their work and life outside of it.",Tena Desae,"Life, Work, Done"

"It might sound unconvincing when an actor like me who has done 500 films says that television is more competitive than movies, but that is the plain truth.",Ranjeet,"Truth, Done, Me"
"Whatever happened to books? Suddenly everybody's talking about these 100-hour movies called 'Breaking Bad'. People are talking about TV the same way they used to talk about novels back in the 1980s. I like to think I hang out with some pretty smart people, but all they talk about is 'Breaking Bad.'",Douglas Coupland,"Smart, Bad People, Bad"
I don't have a lot of patience for movies that aren't cleanly told.,Jon Favreau,"Patience, Lot"
"I decided at age 9, but I was reinforced at age 13 when a teacher told me I had talent. I can't say she really motivated me because I already knew. I knew I had talent.

"Cinema Paradiso, because it reminds me of why I make movies, the magic of movies, the romance of movies.",Antoine Fuqua,"Cinema, Me, Magic"
"The unicorns happened because I legitimately enjoy unicorns; as a kid, one of my favorite movies was called 'The Last Unicorn.'",Xavier Woods,"Enjoy, Last, Happened"
"I think it's more interesting to see people who don't feel appropriately. I relate to that, because sometimes I don't feel anything at all for things I'm supposed to, and other times I feel too much. It's not always like it is in the movies.",Ryan Gosling,"Always, Feel, People"

"I mean, if you look at all the great romantic screwbally kind of movies from the '30s and '40s, they're all in New York.

"I know that movies are basically meant to be entertainment, but I'm not that interested in entertainment.",Scott Rudin,"Know, Entertainment, Meant To Be"
"It is important to consider that the horror movies should - like modern art - not have a too obvious meaning. When you watch them, it is more important what you feel than what you understand.",Christophe Gans,"Art, Important, Feel"
We appreciate quiet living. It's not exactly a Hollywood way of life - I couldn't stand living out in Hollywood because you can never escape from the business. All people ever do is talk about movies. At least in New York you can have some other life.,Frances McDormand,"Life, Business, Stand"
"The first fashion show I ever attended was for Ritu Beri in 1997 or 1998. I think that was the first time Ritu had designed for one of my movies 'Yeh Raastein Hain Pyaar Ke.'

"I've always fantasized about being on TV. And I was. Then I fantasized about being in the movies. What could be better than captain of a space ship? I get to ride horses, shoot guns, have adventures.",Nathan Fillion,"Space, Always, Ride"
"When we go to see comedians or funny movies, they don't address the wall behind them; they face us. This is why a game's first job is to entertain through gameplay and secondarily through humor, drama, or other traditional entertainment devices. The humor has to be a gentleman. I mean, it needs to be squeezed in around the game.",Doug TenNapel,"Funny, Humor, Face"
"I've done movies for certain reasons; I did 'Anaconda' because the black man lives. Simple. The black man isn't dead in the first three pages, like Jurassic Park. It's like, 'The black man kills the snake with a Latino girl? Damn! I got to do this.'",Ice Cube,"Done, Man, Snake"
"Throughout the movies' golden age, the Western enriched Hollywood financially and artistically. But in the 1970s, the genre lost its audience appeal to fantasy films of the 'Star Wars' stripe, which told more or less the same story - elemental animosities leading to an armed showdown - but at a faster tempo, and in outer space.",Richard Corliss,"Age, Space, Lost"

"I've done a great job at being universal in my stand-up, which is why, for 'Let Me Explain,' I toured all over the world. These movies I have coming out - 'Ride Along,' 'Grudge Match,' 'About Last Night,' 'Think Like a Man Too' - are putting me in a position to become universal on an even bigger scale.",Kevin Hart,"Great, Done, Man"

"Maybe I was just born in the wrong era, man. I'm a bit of a throwback to the days of black and white movies. Those guys back then, they had a certain kind of directness about them. A lot of the screenplays, the plots were very simplistic - they gave rise to a type of anti-hero that maybe I suit better.",Michael Madsen,"Man, Black And White, Better"
"I haven't even graduated from high school yet - and I've realised in the last four years, with all the travelling I've done and all of the movies I've made, that the world is my classroom.

"I love the movies, and when I go to see a movie that's been made from one of my books, I know that it isn't going to be exactly like my novel because a lot of other people have interpreted it. But I also know it has an idea that I'll like because that idea occurred to me, and I spent a year, or a year and a half of my life working on it.",Stephen King,"Life, Love, Me"
"I've sat in so many meetings where they talk about converting movies to 3D just for the China market and just to make more money. I saw that people in China work long, long hours and that it's expensive to go to the movies, and you want to rip them off for even more money? I don't think that's right.",Justin Lin,"Work, Money, Long"

"There's this little box that African-American actors have to work in, in the first place, and I was able to rise above that box. I could have done a bunch of movies where I stayed as the Axel Foley or Reggie Hammond persona. But I didn't want to be doing the same thing all the time. Every now and then, you crash and burn, but that's part of it.",Eddie Murphy,"Work, Time, Done"
"I was lucky enough to have an older brother who shared the splatter flicks with me, and I had parents who were cool and involved enough in my life to allow me to see them.

"There are a lot of movies I'd like to throw away. That's not to say that I went in with that attitude. Any film I ever started, I went in with all the hope and best intentions in the world, but some films just don't work.",Kiefer Sutherland,"Attitude, Work, Best"
"We're in a world where masculinity, especially with these big spectacle movies, is often pushed by rippling six packs and forcing an image down someone's throat trying to prove masculinity. Whereas I think true masculinity comes from having a strong sense of self.",Theo James,"World, True, Trying"

"I like a lot of documentaries, I like political movies and political thrillers. But I also like a good action movie. I like a pretty wide range.",John Legend,"Good, Political, Action"

"I once went on a date where the girl drove and so couldn't drink. I was nervous, so drank quite a bit - it didn't end amazingly. As much as I love movies, I think cinema dates can be weird because you essentially sit next to each other in silence for a couple of hours.",Dan Smith,"Love, Silence, Cinema"
"A lot of times I'll make films that are mostly character-driven films - stories that involve people. Like, I make the joke: I like to make movies about human beings that live on Earth.",Rob Reiner,"People, Earth, Live"
"Depending on what happens with my directing career, I don't think I'll stop writing, even if I crash and burn in movies and TV. I'll go back to plays.

I definitely want to study film. I'd like to have my own studio one day and just make a lot of movies.,Alexander Ludwig,"Day, Own, My Own"
I've only been to high school on TV and in movies. I've never actually been to high school.,Emma Roberts,"School, Never, High"
"Underground, raw movies that come out of nowhere and change everything - they aren't slick-looking. But I have nothing against slick-looking as long as the scripts are funny.",John Waters,"Funny, Change, Long"
"The dubbing of the music and effects is really incredible today. You're feeling gun shots. I mean, it's not the way people say it is, but the gunshot sounds real. And cars sound real. Among the many things in the evolution (of movies) is to make the sound in the movie incredible. That's what you feel.",Joel Silver,"Music, Today, Gun"
"I just kind of hang out, watch movies and play golf.",Rickie Fowler,"Golf, Play, Hang"

I would say that 'After the Storm' is much more informed by my personal life than my other movies.,Hirokazu Kore-eda,"Life, Storm, Much"
"Why is the public so interested in movies about the wealthy? My answer is that Shakespeare wrote about kings. That's where the action is. And it's the classic, cathartic thing.

"I usually don't cry at movies, although I will get sad. I'm okay with it, though. It's good to make people cry.",Jacob Tremblay,"Sad, Good, Will"

"What you don't want is for violence and gore to become more important than character and structure. A lot of slasher movies from the eighties were only focused on violence and gore, which robs the human beings in the story of any empathetic reaction from the audience, and instead makes them cheer for the gore.",Mike Flanagan,"Character, Important, Violence"
"I judge movies on how much fun I had while I was doing them. I had a great time on 'The Right Stuff.' Doing that was fantastic.

"I was a semiotics major at Brown, and there's this idea that stories are better, books are better, and movies are better if they cocked you off your axis and you were completely disoriented and you'd really have to rethink everything. Nobody has that experience, actually.",Ira Glass,"Experience, Your, Better"
"I read tons of books, listen to music non-stop, watch as many movies as possible, catch a play when I can, art shows, concerts, bar talks - I just try to engage in art, which to me is everywhere, as often as I can because narrative lives in it all.",Jason Reynolds,"Art, Music, Me"
"Only directors like Sanjay Leela Bhansali, who make period films, have songs in their movies that facilitate the inclusion of classical dance forms. No one else is concentrating on making pure classical numbers.",Remo D'Souza,"Dance, Numbers, Inclusion"

It was cool when the Duffers assigned a list of movies to watch.,Finn Wolfhard,"Cool, Watch, List"

I love crying at romantic movies like 'The Notebook.' I'm always bawling.,Fergie,"Love, Romantic, Always"

"No matter how many times you've seen the movies and the TV shows that have a protagonist leaping in the path of a bullet, physics forbids such sacrifice.

"If you really spend time with movies, it's three years of your life from beginning to end. I started out planting the seed with 'Monster's Ball' about independent cinema and raising money and that whole thing as a producer, and then it becomes easier for me.",Lee Daniels,"Life, Time, Money"

"I love to hang out with my friends and go to the movies. My mom and I are involved in the Mother/Daughter Organization - national charity work. Whenever I get free time, we volunteer.

"'The Exorcist' is one of the finest movies ever made, and it just so happens to be a scary movie.",James Wan,"Happens, Just, Made"
"If you look at films about becoming a man, coming-of-age movies are made with 12-, 16-, 40-, 50-year-olds... For a guy to feel like he's a 100 percent grown-up is almost like giving up. Like admitting that you're on your way into the grave.",Kevin Bacon,"Man, Your, Look"
I've never been interested in action movies. Definitely not interested in sci-fi.,Carrie-Anne Moss,"Action, Never, Not Interested"

Think about scary movies: There's a fine line between horror and humor.,"Roy Blount, Jr.","Humor, Think, Fine"
"My love for American music and American movies is from an early age. I was 10 or 11 when I heard Fats Domino and Little Richard and Buddy Holly. And the movies, my dad used to take my brother and I to the movies every Friday. It was incredible: we got to see just about every movie that came out for a period of years.",Ian McLagan,"Love, Age, Music"
"'Fast Times At Ridgemont High' is one of my favorite movies; it's a film that's a human comedy, it's a drama, and the characters all, in a way, fit the teenage archetypes, but they don't become stereotypes because each of the actors brought their own presence and their own personality to the screen.",Josh Trank,"Personality, Stereotypes, Way"
"I thought movies were handed down by God. I knew that theater was made by people because I saw the people in front of me, but movies seemed like they were delivered, wholly made, from Zeus's head or something.",Greta Gerwig,"God, Me, People"
"One of the best things about directing movies, as opposed to merely writing them, is that there's no confusion about who's to blame: you are.",Nora Ephron,"Best, Blame, Confusion"

"I like to think I'm making films in the film business where movies are making enough numbers for the studios to let me keep working, but you also want those films to have content that makes you proud you made the film. That's not easy, but it's a fun puzzle to figure out.",Wes Craven,"Business, Puzzle, Me"
"The less lines, the better. I am the silent film actor, but not in a slapstick sort of way. Film is an image-based medium, so whatever you can say without the words is far more provocative and punctuating. If the lines are not funny or if they don't advance the story, sometimes it's hard. I hate talk in movies.",Callum Keith Rennie,"Funny, Hate, Better"
I feel there is no substitute for going out to the movies. There is nothing like it.,Steven Spielberg,"Nothing, Feel, Like"

"Man's inhumanity to man is as old as humanity itself. Some people just do evil things. Most do not. A billion people have seen 'Batman' movies over the past 20 years, and they have been entertained and inspired. One man saw it as a sick entry point for mass murder. The one is tragic. The billion are not. I choose to write for the billion.",Kurt Sutter,"Man, Past, Humanity"

I'm a frustrated would-be architect who stumbled into the would-be business of making movies.,Michael Cimino,"Business, Who, Architect"

Only really good comedies and really good horror movies get a verbal response out of the audience. People will scream. People will laugh.,Fede Alvarez,"Good, Laugh, Will"

Sometimes I regret that the wonderful children's stories that have been made into movies were - people no longer read 'The Wizard of Oz'; they think they know the story. They don't know anything about all the bits and pieces they had to leave out.,Robin Hobb,"Regret, Know, Children"

"I love the beautiful distractions of the world - television and movies, video games, the Internet in general. But I try really hard to avoid them, because they don't help me become a better writer. They subtract hours from my day. And a writer's main currency is time. Time to daydream, time to walk and think, time to sit and do the work.",Nick Petrie,"Love, Work, Time"
"Punk's influence on music, movies, art, design and fashion is no longer in doubt. It is used as the measurement for what is cool.",Malcolm Mclaren,"Design, Cool, Art"
"When you look at movies, the lead girl is always gorgeous and thin. There is a stereotype that you need to look a certain way and when you get in the business you really feel the pressure.",Margot Robbie,"Business, Always, Look"
"I grew up in Alice, Texas, a small oil town with one theater that only showed Roy Rogers movies. So when I got the role, I had never even seen a Bond film and had only had a vague notion about the idea of a Bond girl.",Lois Chiles,"Bond, Never, Girl"

"I was very much aiming to go into movies eventually, like a lot of 'SNL' people.

"Whenever I have time, I do my fitness. I go running on my own on Sundays or on Eid. I'd rather gym every day than go watch movies.",Imran Tahir,"Time, Fitness, Day"

"The next thing I knew, I was out of the service and making movies again. My first picture was called, GI Blues. I thought I was still in the army.",Elvis Presley,"Service, Picture, Army"
"I suppose we all loved those kind of sci-fi movies where terrible things came out of swamps and came to Mars. And there's usually some poor girl. All the guys are trying to desperately handle levers and saying, go to something or other.",Neil Innes,"Mars, Poor, Trying"
"I like 'Reanimator,' and I like 'Evil Dead 2.' But I really like the Corman movies from the late '60s and early '70s, and my favorite is 'The Mask of Red Death' with Vincent Price because - spoiler alert - but at the end of the movie, Vincent Price, he's the evil prince, and to kill him, his court just, like, dances at him.",Owen King,"Death, Mask, Evil"

I also love horror movies; I like me a big Peter Berg action movie. I'm a movie lover in general.,Jenna Fischer,"Love, Me, Action"
"Write comic books if you love comic books so much that you want to write them. Don't write them like movies. Comics can do a lot of things that movies can't do, and vice versa.",Grant Morrison,"Love, Much, Things"

Nobody should come to the movies unless he believes in heroes.,John Wayne,"Nobody, Come, Heroes"

"I hate horror movies, with a passion.",Katee Sackhoff,"Hate, Passion, Horror Movies"

"If you look at Indian movies, every time they wanted an exotic locale, they would have a dance number in Kashmir. Kashmir was India's fairyland. Indians went there because in a hot country you go to a cold place. People would be entranced by the sight of snow.",Salman Rushdie,"Time, Kashmir, Look"
I produced six movies with Amy Robinson since the very early '80s.,Griffin Dunne,"Early, Six, Since"
"When we were doing 'Freaks and Geeks', I didn't quite understand how movies and TV worked, and I would improvise even if the camera wasn't on me. I thought I was helping the other actors by keeping them on their toes, but nobody appreciated it when I would trip them up. So I was improvising a little bit back then, but not in a productive way.",James Franco,"Me, Doing, Way"

"Here's the thing. We do a movie with a predominantly black cast, and it's put in a category of being a black film. When other movies are done with a predominantly white cast, we don't call them a white film. I'm trying to remove the stigma off things they call black films.",Kevin Hart,"Done, Black, White"

"Movies are fun, but they are no cure for cancer.",Clint Eastwood,"Fun, Cure, Cancer"
I think that weird rumor or idea in Hollywood that people don't want to see female-driven movies couldn't be further from the truth. Women buy tickets to movies.,Michelle Monaghan,"Women, Truth, People"
"Making movies has become such a golden ring, and it's all such a big business, that the rewards system has gotten totally out of whack. Suddenly, you're treated in a manner befitting someone who is actually an important person.",Ben Affleck,"Business, Important, Person"
"When I was a kid, I really loved watching 'Cinderella.' It's a fantasy, and every girl knows that real life isn't always like these movies, but as a child, I just really loved the story of 'Cinderella.' I found it to be so romantic and just a beautiful movie to watch.",Sara Ramirez,"Life, Romantic, Beautiful"
The problem with romantic comedies is you know the ending by the poster. So they're not movies you can keep doing over and over again expect satisfaction somehow.,Ryan Reynolds,"Romantic, Satisfaction, Doing"
"A James Bond film can be artistically fulfilling. Absolutely it can. It can be complex, and it can be interesting.

You see the same sort of action in 'Punch and Judy' or in the folk theatre of various cultures, like 'Grand Guignol.'",Christoph Waltz,"Bond, Action, See"
"Rap for me is like making movies, telling stories, and getting the emotions of the songs through in just as deep a way.",Jay-Z,"Me, Emotions, Way"
"More and more, you're seeing television shows that are better than 99% of the movies out there.

"During my school and college days, the three Khans - Aamir, Salman and Shah Rukh - were superstars for me and will always be. Their movies were eagerly awaited every Friday.",Shahid Kapoor,"Always, Me, Will"
"I have no personal experience in the military. All I know about it is what I've seen in movies and read in books and watched on television. My knowledge is probably no more or no less than the average person's. 'A Brief Encounter with the Enemy' was created by taking bits and pieces from here and there, and then putting my own spin on them.",Said Sayrafiezadeh,"Knowledge, Experience, Know"
"In the morning, I'm like the Antonioni movies. I'm little sad. I haven't the courage to start the day. In the evenings, I'm happier, more alive - like the character I play in 'An Almost Perfect Affair.'",Monica Vitti,"Courage, Sad, Morning"
"I saw 'A Clockwork Orange' when I was 11. When you watch 'Clockwork Orange' at 11, it either totally scares you from watching movies, or you want to become a filmmaker. I was the latter.",Bill Hader,"Watching, Orange, Become"
"My dad had a commercial film company, so he had a videotape player before anyone. So he got Mel Brooks movies or Citizen Kane or some classic old movies. And every summer the revival house in Evanston would show the great films from the '50s and '60s and '70s.",John Cusack,"Great, Dad, Company"

I think less is more when it comes to kissing in the movies.,Julia Roberts,"Think, More, Less Is More"
"I love watching old movies, and some of the holiday-themed ones are really great. I also have a bizarre thing that I'll do: I'll turn on a foreign-language TV station, usually Spanish, and watch a whole show, riveted, even though I have no idea what anyone is saying. I don't know why I find that so addictive, but I do!",John Travolta,"Love, Great, Know"
"A financial shift happened with 'Facing the Giants' and 'Fireproof,' where movies that were faith-based films were profitable. And people in Hollywood - like people in downtown U.S.A. - are out to make money.",John Schneider,"Money, People, Financial"
"The Jetsons had them in the 1960s. They were the defining element of 'Knight Rider' in the 1980s: cars that drive themselves. Self-driving cars appear in countless science fiction movies. By Hollywood standards, they are so normal we don't even notice them. But in real life, they still don't exist. What if you could buy one today?",Sebastian Thrun,"Life, Science, Today"
"It's nice to see a story that centers around other couples, instead of having, you know, the sassy gay friend or the funny best friend or the assistant, which is just like these stereotypical roles that tend to be put in movies.",Scott Evans,"Funny, Best, Gay"
"When 'Blade Runner' came out, and especially, even actually when 'Alien' came out, it kind of changed how all science fiction movies were designed after that. And that was a really great thing.

"I'm married to a nurse, and she is really, really ardent that - in screenplays or movies that I've worked on, that all the medical aspects be properly presented.

I made two movies before The Police had a hit record: I did Quadrophenia and a film called Radio On.,Sting,"Police, Radio, Two"
"If I have a male protagonist, it's a studio movie, and if it's a female protagonist, it's an indie movie. That's just how it is. It's not about the studios. It's about America and who goes to see movies. Women are interested in men and women, and men aren't interested in the woman's story. They just aren't.",Mike White,"Women, Men, Woman"

"Average Americans order nonfat decaf iced vanilla lattes at Starbucks and choose from 1,500 drawer pulls at The Great Indoors. Amazon gives every town a bookstore with 2 million titles, while Netflix promises 35,000 different movies on DVD. Choice is everywhere - liberating to some, but to others, a new source of stress.",Virginia Postrel,"Great, Stress, New"
Movies may be as close to a document of our national culture as there is; they're supposed to represent what we believe ourselves to be. So when you don't see yourself at all - or see yourself erased - that hurts.,John Cho,"Culture, Believe, Yourself"
I've always felt that really good prequels should be original movies.,Damon Lindelof,"Good, Always, Be Original"
"I play a character called Lieutenant Delcourt who, in the original comics, pops up from time to time to rescue Tintin. I guess if you've grown up watching movies like 'Jaws' and 'Indiana Jones,' it's pretty surreal to find yourself on set with Steven Spielberg directing you.",Tony Curran,"Time, Character, Yourself"
"I certainly grew up seeing more movies and television than I read books, but when it came time to do the thing itself you don't have to hire a lot of people to sit down and write a book, so that was the story-telling medium that was available to me.",John Sayles,"Time, Me, People"
I'm interested in existential films: I love movies that console you in the same way that a person consoles a weeping child.,Louis Garrel,"Love, Way, Person"
"I remember watching Audrey Hepburn dancing in movies, and I was inspired by how graceful she looked, though I understand it was no easy task.",Yuan Yuan Tan,"Remember, Easy, Understand"
"I often begin movies with music in my head; it's a very important dimension to me. Not just the music itself, but how to use music in film: when and how and subtlety. I don't like to be too sweet in my stories, and I like the abrasive clang, the contrasting of sounds and cultures.",Mira Nair,"Music, Sweet, Me"
"There have been 14 versions that I can find of Burke & Hare movies. They have all been horror films and all the movies have taken place in Victorian times, which doesn't make any sense.",John Landis,"Find, Place, I Can"
"In terms of the romantic kind of lead, I just never enjoy those movies very much. Maybe they'll come to interest me more as I get older. I doubt it, but maybe. Romantic comedies tend to be, for me, an oxymoron.",Christian Bale,"Romantic, Me, Doubt"
'Kill Bill' is one of my favorite movies of all time.,Lee Pace,"Time, Favorite, Bill"
"I was dirt-poor. I could barely hold down a job. Eventually, though, I started getting small parts on shows like 'Smallville,' 'Supernatural'... and lots of really bad sci-fi movies. I was running around the woods in wolf contacts, covered in fake blood made out of pancake syrup, roaring.",Cory Monteith,"Bad, Woods, Job"
"It sucks to be the runner-up because I've been the runner-up for a long time in my career. I would get so close and then lose a huge movie and sometimes it's one kid who beats you out for three different movies. It's so frustrating at the time, but what's so great is the lesson you take from that, which is, 'I've got to get better.'",Jason Dohring,"Time, Great, Long"
I've always been optimistic. And I have a feeling that it happened because of going to all those movies with my grandmother in the '40s because there was no cynicism.,Carol Burnett,"Always, Feeling, Happened"
"Christopher Nolan's 'Batman Begins' set the bar very high for the superhero movie, as it showed that you could get a great cast for these movies and take a real filmmaker's perspective.",Jon Favreau,"Great, Perspective, Real"
"These superhero movies are starting to give more love to not only black characters but also to more female characters, which is necessary because you have boys and girls of all colors who are looking at these superheroes saying, 'I want to be that. I want to look like that. Show me somebody that I can automatically connect with.'",Aldis Hodge,"Love, Colors, Me"
"I love science fiction, but I have a hard time feeling for characters in a galaxy far away. Choosing movies is the one thing in my life where there's no compromising.",Leonardo DiCaprio,"Life, Love, Science"
"In 'Expendables 2,' there was a lot of vulgar dialogue in the screenplay. For this reason, many young people wouldn't be able to watch this. But I don't play in movies like this. Due to that, I said, 'I won't be a part of that if the hardcore language is not erased.'",Chuck Norris,"Language, People, Reason"
"I love it, man; I'm 23 years old and I'm lucky enough to write movies as a job! I just feel really blessed and can't believe it's happening.",Jonah Hill,"Love, Man, Believe"
"I have done many movies that people hadn't seen. 'The Fountain,' I spent a year on that. 'The Prestige' with Chris Nolan, and 'Australia.' From my perspective it's very satisfying. Some movies people see and other movies they don't. 'Wolverine,' 'X Men,' I know that in some level people know me just for that and it's fine for me.",Hugh Jackman,"Men, Done, Me"
"Television in itself is a very big platform, and movies are even bigger. So we cannot compare both of them.",Sara Khan,"Television, Big, Cannot"
I like movies where you can come back and re-watch them and admire the cinematography 25 years later.,Rob Zombie,"Cinematography, Admire, Back"
"Movies are all about plot. Theater, even if it's story heavy, it's about ideas.",Harvey Fierstein,"Ideas, Story, Heavy"
"The good guys in my movies mind their own business, and they don't judge other people. And the bad guys are jealous; they judge other people without knowing the whole story. They want all the attention, and they're mean spirited.",John Waters,"Good, Business, Mind"
"I never had an imaginary friend, just imaginary circumstances. I was so into the Indiana Jones movies, and I would constantly reenact circumstances. I broke my left arm three times, two of which were me trying to be Indiana Jones.",Pedro Pascal,"Me, Circumstances, Trying"
"A man becomes what he dreams. And I dreamed of being in the movies. I was brought up on Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood, Warren Beatty, and Cary Grant.",Pierce Brosnan,"Dreams, Man, Being"
"In live action movies, you just hope that everything works. Because the actor may had a bad morning and doesn't play good, or accidents happen continuously. Many things contradict what you are trying to say. But in cartoons, nothing contradict what you want to say.",John Hench,"Hope, Good, Morning"
The things I see now on TV and in movies are so outlandish. Kids doing rude things with pies! And the language that they use! It's being outrageous for the sake of being outrageous. I can't watch it. It turns me off.,Sid Caesar,"Me, Doing, Language"
"The idea of having different characters is really just to get the storyline across, you know? Coming from one particular character makes, to me, the story boring. I get that mainly from novels and that style of writing or movies where there's multiple characters who carry the storyline.",MF Doom,"Character, Me, Boring"
"The person that made me want to make movies, and the reason I do films, is Bruce Lee. He was an incredible actor, and he had a lot of charisma. Handsome, action, you know, everything was there. I loved Bruce Lee.",LL Cool J,"Handsome, Me, Know"
"It'll be the Internet and piracy that will kill film. There's a philosophy that the Internet should be free, but the reality is that piracy will destroy the film industry and film as an art form because it's expensive to make a movie. Maybe you'll have funky little independent movies, and it'll go back and then start up again some other way.",Helen Mirren,"Art, Internet, Reality"
"I was directing as a kid in movies, and that was always my strongest interest. When I was under contract at Universal, I conned an editing room out of them and spent my money to rent a camera and shoot film and make some movies.",Tim Matheson,"Money, Always, Editing"
"I'm not a big prank guy, because I don't like them done to me. I've been on movies sets where one guys goes into his trailer, and then people move the stairs, and he comes out of his trailer, and there's no stairs. That's not funny! I don't want to be that guy!",Terry Crews,"Funny, Done, Me"
"Everyone remembers the pop-quiz hotshot bit from 'Speed' because it's extremely funny, and it's really smart and really witty. And the notion that action movies can have dialogue that pops just as well as the explosions is something that I hope more people continue to remember.",Graham Moore,"Funny, Hope, Smart"

"Television has its own award. It's called the Emmy. It's a good award. I like it. I have one. But you don't see movies like 'The King's Speech' win Oscars and then go to TV and qualify for Emmys. In documentaries, some networks have been able to game the system.",Michael Moore,"Good, Award, King"
"I'm into 'The Walking Dead,' 'Shaun of the Dead,' obviously, and I've seen all the Romero movies. I am a classic zombie queen. And I love the White Walkers on 'Game of Thrones.' Weirdly, it wasn't until pretty late in life that I found my entry point into horror films.",Anna Kendrick,"Life, Love, Game"
"There's a classic element that all good Disney movies have. It really comes down to the storytelling, I think. It manages to push all of these buttons inside of us; there's a sentimentality.",Mandy Moore,"Good, Push, Down"
"I rarely see one of the 'summer blockbuster' movies. I'd like to see a stronger focus on smaller, smarter movies.",Christopher Meloni,"Focus, Stronger, See"
"People start panicking because they think it's the end of everything. But the fact is, you know, books survived movies; books survived TV. Books are surviving manga and anime. Books will always be there in one form or another. You just have a larger palette of entertainment options.",John Scalzi,"Always, Start, Will"
"Growing up, my best friend was the movie theaters. I'd go to the movies every week, multiple times a week, with my dad or alone.",Charles Melton,"Alone, Best, Dad"

I don't miss acting. I don't even see movies. I don't see plays. I don't watch television.,Charles Grodin,"Television, Acting, See"
"I like Telugu movies, then comes Bollywood and then English movies. In Tollywood, I like Mahesh Babu and Prabhas. But no, I don't watch all their movies. I first find out if the movie is nice. If it's a flop, I don't watch it.",P. V. Sindhu,"Find, First, Nice"
"I've tried to reinvent myself from time to time, and I enjoy doing movies.",Bill Goldberg,"Time, Myself, Doing"

"I would love to do more movies. I'd like to get into some theater, too, if I could, just to learn more. I want to do gritty performances that I'm proud of.

"All my good movies, nobody sees.",Chris Evans,"Good, Nobody, Sees"
"I think violence, cynicism, brutality and fashion are the staples of our diet. I think in the grand history of story-telling, going back to people sitting around fires, the dark side of human nature has always been very important. Movies are part of that tradition.",Eric Stoltz,"Nature, History, Diet"
The reason I took Early Edition - besides the fact that I liked it - was that it enabled me to start a production company in New York City. It's a low-budget film company to produce and direct movies.,Fisher Stevens,"City, Me, Start"
"It's like those high-school yearbook photos that everyone would rather not see: Oh my God, look at that mullet hair. I have those photos too, but for me, they're, like, entire movies. And they show them on cable.",John Cusack,"God, Me, Hair"
"There's a few movies I wanted to do, and I didn't get to do them partly because they wanted me to be part of the horse and pony show, getting the money, and I'm just not doing that. There's a few movies that people wanted me to do, but they were too safe.",Frank Oz,"Money, Me, Doing"
"Movies began as a communal experience. Even though we now watch them as DVD's, sometimes alone on our computers, mostly in the history of cinema it has been a communal experience.",Alison Owen,"Alone, History, Experience"
"In our culture, many of us idealize love. We see it as some lofty cure-all for all of life's problems. Our movies and our stories and our history all celebrate it as life's ultimate goal, the final solution for all of our pain and struggle. And because we idealize love, we overestimate it. As a result, our relationships pay a price.",Mark Manson,"Life, Love, History"
I have been pregnant in so many movies it's ridiculous.,Jennifer Aniston,"Ridiculous, Many, Been"
"There's not much to do in Atlanta, so the cast went to the gym together, went shopping together, and dinner was always a group thing. It's that whole summer-camp experience that making movies tends to be anyway.",Timothy Olyphant,"Experience, Always, Together"
I like cable: you only work four months out of the year and have the other eight months to do movies if you want.,Travis Fimmel,"Work, Only, Want"

I was glad to know that 'Caravan' was one of the first movies from Bollywood that was loved by the Chinese audience.,Jeetendra,"Know, First, Audience"
"I got really into Martin Scorsese as a teenager, so then it was kind of the whole reason I wanted to be an actor. Just like tons of young actors, I think, get freaked out by the Scorsese/DeNiro movies. I loved all his movies in the '90s, too. Then I got a part in 'The Aviator' and couldn't believe it.",Adam Scott,"Believe, Reason, Young"
"If people are constantly reading about you, and you're overexposed, they've got no reason to go see your movies. Also, it's not pleasant or nice to have your privacy invaded.",John Cusack,"Your, Privacy, People"
"Since I got into the movies, 'Running Scared,' that did $40 million. 'Princess Bride,' I got good reviews for the character Miracle Max. 'Memories of Me' didn't do well.

"When my mother got home from work, she would take me to the movies. It was her way of getting out, and she would take me with her. I'd go home and act all the parts. It had a tremendous influence on my becoming an actor.",Al Pacino,"Work, Home, Me"

"When I can't sleep, I'll start thinking about how many shows I've done, count up the number of television shows and movies.",Robert Wagner,"Done, Thinking, Sleep"

The key to making good movies is to pay attention to the transition between scenes.,Steven Soderbergh,"Good, Attention, Key"
"Back 20 years ago, there was a division between movie actors and TV actors. That's kind of gone away. People who have had a lot of success in movies in the past now want to be on TV. There used to be much more of a quality division between TV and movies, and that's kind of not the case anymore.",Michael Imperioli,"Success, Past, Quality"
Movies are a fad. Audiences really want to see live actors on a stage.,Charlie Chaplin,"Stage, Live, See"
"I was a little tomboy, growing up, but we had to go to the library every weekend if we wanted some form of entertainment. And I would gravitate towards the Shirley Temple, Judy Garland section of the library, and I would just pop that in and watch on replay because kids can watch movies over and over again.",Isabela Moner,"Temple, Library, Entertainment"
"The only thing I can't do is hear. I can drive, I have a life with four kids, I work on TV, I do movies, so the deafness question, is it that they want to know because, what? Not sure.",Marlee Matlin,"Life, Work, Drive"
"My movies are painfully personal, but I'm never trying to let you know how personal they are. It's my job to make it be personal, and also to disguise that so only I or the people who know me know how personal it is. 'Kill Bill' is a very personal movie.",Quentin Tarantino,"Me, Know, People"

I have stayed away from films which I thought were depressing.",Kajol,"Love, Best, Done"

"Movies don't look hard, but figuring it out, getting the shape of it, getting everybody's character right and having it be funny, make sense and be romantic, it's creating a puzzle.

"Some of the top grossing movies now are children's animated features, they're making more money than action movies.

I always argued against the auteur theory; films are a collaborative art form. I've had some fantastically good people help me make the movies.,Alan Parker,"Good, Art, Always"

"It's said that most Americans under the age of 30 reflexively dislike movies made before 1970, especially those that were shot in black and white. If this is so, I suspect it's because such films portray an America that no longer exists.",Terry Teachout,"Age, Black And White, Black"

"A role I grew up with and always loved was James Bond. I'd even say, in some ways, that he served as a creative role model for me as a kid in terms of roles I would want to play.

"I have a little bit of a pet peeve about how the middle class is depicted in movies.

When it's done well, it's brilliant, it's 'Blue Velvet.'",Greg Mottola,"Pet, Done, Heart"
