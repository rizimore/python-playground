I would say I don't like people who are really into themselves or are very materialistic. Just always talking themselves up. Not being real is the pet peeve. Be true to yourself.,Austin Stowell,"Always, Yourself, True"
I already have a pet project called Project Shakti and it aims on educating women on menstruation cycle.,Manushi Chhillar,"Women, Project, Cycle"

"Just like hair frames our face, brows frame our eyes. I see so much potential in harmonized beauty whenever I see a woman who's not filling in her brows, and I just want to go in with my brow pencil and just be like, 'Filling in eyebrows, OK, done - look in the mirror and be inspired.' That's one of my pet peeves, but beauty is subjective.",Michelle Phan,"Beauty, Eyes, Done"

"There are conventions for people with serious, boring inventions, but fad inventors need help. You need someone to talk to. You just can't tell your friends you're going to invent a pet rock and mortgage your house to pay for it. It's embarrassing... risky mentally. Your friends think you're crazy.",Ken Hakuta,"Your, Crazy, Boring"
"You can scroll through my iTunes and I've got everything.

One of my pet peeves in athleisure today is clothes that make a woman feel square and one-dimensional.,Anna Kaiser,"Today, Woman, Feel"
One of my big pet peeves is single-use plastic bags. I think it's one of the stupidest ideas in the world.,"Philippe Cousteau, Jr.","World, Ideas, Big"
"In their heyday, the Pet Shop Boys were the Interpol of the Eighties, dressing up to sing really weird pop songs about lust and loneliness in the big city. They're low-pro now, not retro-worshipped in the manner of Depeche Mode, New Order, or The Cure, but you can hear the reason why - these guys are too sad.",Rob Sheffield,"Sad, Loneliness, City"
"Pet foods come in a variety of flavors because that's what humans like, and we assume our pets like what we like. We're wrong.",Mary Roach,"Wrong, Come, Like"
One of my pet peeves about Nashville is that it tends to be copycatted. I don't want to do that. I've got to be different.,Blake Shelton,"Be Different, Different, Want"

And this sounds crazy, but I really believe they know what is happening and are appreciative, and I just think they make for the best pets.",Jim O'Heir,"Best, Good, Home"
"I had a big Akita, Yoshi, who was fabulous. I loved him. We lost him when he was 12, and I've never been able to replace him. Normally, most people lose a pet and get another and keep going on. But it just felt wrong to me; it felt disloyal.",Robert Crais,"Keep Going, Lose, Me"
"It's just so nice when your pet isn't all needy. I need a lot of space, so dogs suffocate me.",Kerli,"Space, Your, Me"
"I spent a lot of time in the White House in the public areas where reporters are allowed to go, but I spoke to people about the private quarters as well.

For example, the fact that there were still pet stains on the carpets from the Bush cats when the Obamas moved in.",Jodi Kantor,"Time, White, People"
"I love animals. I just don't want to have a pet. That's OK, right? I would take a dog over a cat, at least to interact with you. I feel like cats just stare you down all the time. Cats have, like, bad attitudes.",Erin Foster,"Love, Time, Bad"
"I believe giving pets 'people food,' while tempting, is generally frowned upon. As a pet owner you want to prioritize your animal's health over the entertainment value in watching your little guy bat around a small piece of chicken.",Aesop Rock,"Health, Food, Your"
"Every time someone buys a cat or a dog from a breeder or a pet shop, a cat on the streets or in an animal shelter loses his or her chance at finding a good home.",Amy Jackson,"Good, Time, Home"
"Growing up, I had an insane crush on Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys.",Erin O'Connor,"Growing Up, Up, Insane"

"One of my biggest pet peeves is when a guy's wearing flip-flop sandals, which I don't understand. Men's feet are disgusting to begin with, but now they're on display when I try to go out for a nice steak at a restaurant, and I have to sit there and look at some guy's hoof? I don't get it. I don't understand it.",Sebastian Maniscalco,"Men, Feet, Look"

"There are things that I invented - the creaky geriatric robot that is always grumpy, for example, or the little wheelie guy, he's not in the Hasbro lore. But kids love that stuff - this little guy as a pet on a chain. They gravitate towards it.",Michael Bay,"Love, Always, Things"
"My biggest pet peeve, I guess, is other comedians criticizing Larry the Cable Guy.",Ron White,"Guess, Comedians, Guy"

"People were a little leery when I was doing the press for my last album 'Rumble Doll,' yes. It's always that thing that this is a dilettante or a pet project.",Patti Scialfa,"Always, Doing, People"
"Some men over-tweeze their eyebrows, and it's just too perfect. Men are meant to have kind of a bushy brow. Too much aftershave is also off-putting; it's one of my pet hates.",David Beckham,"Men, Perfect, Much"
"I have a little bit of a pet peeve about how the middle class is depicted in movies. I feel like they tend to be either depicted in a very sentimental way, where everybody has a heart of gold except for the villains you're supposed to hiss at, or there's a sort of indie-style version... When it's done well, it's brilliant, it's 'Blue Velvet.'",Greg Mottola,"Movies, Done, Heart"
"I have the same pet peeve as Anderson Cooper, which is bare feet in public. I hate it. It so grosses me out, especially in New York. Oh my God, New York in the summer with people and their feet in their sandals and their flip-flops, like get it away!",Busy Philipps,"God, Hate, Feet"

"When a guy tells me I'm cute, it's not something desirable. Cute is more like what you want your pet to be.",Natalie Portman,"Your, Me, Cute"
"I am a pet person. My dog actually lives in Georgia now. But I work with animal trainers and pets quite often. I also volunteer at different places like animal shelters. It's good to be around pets.

"You know what I hate? I hate people who give me plants. The whole giving someone plants - it's like giving someone a pet.

"I had a Super Beetle that I restored and painted deep purple in honor of Jimi Hendrix that was stolen.

A pet can be a girl's best friend.,Jasmin Bhasin,"Best, Girl, Friend"

"I read very one-note. Teacher's pet, Goody Two-shoes. I'd hate to be annoying. Who wants to see movies with someone annoying in them? But it's hard for me to paint myself as anything but whatever it is I come across as - which is pretty together.",Allison Williams,"Teacher, Movies, Myself"
"I love pigs. I think they're very cute. I really want a pet pig, but those micro pigs, they don't stay micro.",Nicole Byer,"Love, Cute, Stay"

I try not to wear anything I have to fidget with - there's nothing worse than wearing something and pulling down the hem and re-adjusting the top. My pet hate is when girls wear those strapless dresses and spend the whole night yanking them up.,Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"Hate, Night, Nothing"
Ill-fitted T-shirts stretched over a gut are my pet hate. And if the colour's faded - ugh.,Joanne Froggatt,"Hate, Colour, Gut"

Environmentalists hate sprawl - except when it comes to the size of their expansive pet legislation on Capitol Hill.,Michelle Malkin,"Hate, Hill, Size"
Don't buy furs: that's No. 1. You can start with that. Then spay and neuter your pets. We destroy millions of them a year. Go to an animal shelter for a cat or dog. And read a book about how to care properly for your particular pet.,Loretta Swit,"Your, Start, Care"
"I saw myself as a teacher's pet but with a little of Ed Haskell mixed in. I was the teacher's pet, but that didn't mean that I was trying to pull one over.",Damon Lindelof,"Teacher, Myself, Trying"
"For many people who are so lost in their minds, so much involved in their thought processes, the only moments they have when they are not trapped in that is when they are relating to their animal, their pet.",Eckhart Tolle,"Lost, People, Animal"
People didn't think animals thought or remembered or had minds! They most certainly do: any pet owner knows more than a lot of scientists about animals.,Elizabeth Marshall Thomas,"People, Animals, Remembered"
I noticed that on the Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds' record they could get away with racy lyrics like that because of how they looked and the melodic way they sang the suggestive stuff. They slid it by the censors.,Eric Carmen,"Way, Lyrics, Beach"

Nine days out of 10, I do it quite happily.",Ali Liebegott,"Food, Living, True"
"Though each trainer believes his or her method is best, I don't think it matters which method the pet owner adopts so long as that owner finds a capable mentor and sticks with the training. Eventually you will learn to see your dog, and when that happens, the richness of your and your dog's lives will tell you what to do next.",Donald McCaig,"Best, Your, Long"
"It's a little known fact that one in three family pets gets lost during its lifetime, and approximately 9 million pets enter shelters each year. That's why it's a wonderful thing to get your pet microchipped and registered with your contact information because then they can be located and the owners can track where their pets are.",Betty White,"Family, Your, Information"
"Millions of animals are euthanized every year because shelters can't find homes for them. Buying animals from pet stores also tends to support puppy and cat mills, many of which have deplorable conditions for animals, which shouldn't be tolerated.",Laura Mennell,"Support, Find, Animals"
Teach your children how to behave with animals. Adopt a pet. Don't go buy one. Please. That's a sin. Let's get these puppy mills out of business.,Shelley Morrison,"Business, Your, Sin"
"A lizard is a perfect pet for a model. They only need feeding once a fortnight. And I'm always travelling, so it's perfect. If I had a dog, it would drop dead of starvation.",Abbey Lee Kershaw,"Always, Dog, Dead"

"I think you can totally be a totally normal kid from the suburbs of Chicago and go off and play shows.

"Truth be told, ginormous portions have become a pet peeve of mine.",Hal Sparks,"Truth, Mine, Become"
"I have a lot of trouble understanding how people see me as a celebrity. I work 14 hours a day, and then I just want to talk to my family, see the people I love, pet my dog, and go to bed. I'm not looking to be best friends with or emulate a celebrity.",America Ferrera,"Love, Work, Best"

"You can get too bogged down in technology and you can sort of forget what it is you were trying to do. And with the Pet Shop Boys it's primarily about the songs, it's about song writing.",Chris Lowe,"Technology, Song, Trying"
I've never written a 'Revolver' or a 'Pet Sounds.',Richard Ashcroft,"Never, Sounds, Written"
"I don't read good books anymore, it seems; I just buy them and put them on the shelf and every now and then walk over and pet them.

I know just what I want to do when I retire.",Mary Roach,"Dreams, Good, Walk"
"Women are often scrutinized when they have pets that men wouldn't have. We are immediately faulted for having the wrong kind of pet rather than anyone first think, 'Wow, she rescued an animal that would have been otherwise killed and gave them a great home - how sweet!'",Iliza Shlesinger,"Women, Home, Men"
Pet Sematary' is one of my favorite books of Stephen King and I have a deep love relationship with it.,Andy Muschietti,"Love, Relationship, King"

"My best time to write is right after coffee and breakfast - four eggs - because, full disclosure, I'm really a komodo dragon - and that's because then I'm energized but not so awake that the critical voice clicks on, the voice that sometimes says, 'Don't write that,' or, 'Man, that sentence is terrible - you should give up and go pet the cats.'",Jeff Vandermeer,"Best, Time, Man"

I wish to avail myself of all that is already known and then, if possible, add my mite to help on the future worker who will attain final success.",Wilbur Wright,"Success, Future, Myself"

"My big pet peeve with people posting food - and I love it when people post food - but my number one thing is when you're posting at a restaurant, and it's dark, like a date night, food never looks good.

I would draw these pictures. I had hundreds of these pictures in a box.",James Gunn,"Water, Create, Alien"
"A pet store is a celebration of dogs' existence and an explosion of options. About cats, a pet store seems to say, 'Here, we couldn't think of anything else.'
