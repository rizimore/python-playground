"I think of love and marriage in the same way I do plants: We have perennials and annuals. The perennial plant blooms, goes away, and comes back. The annual blooms for just a season, and then winter arrives and takes it out for good. But it's still enriched the soil for the next flower to bloom. In the same way, no love is wasted.",Glennon Doyle Melton,"Love, Good, Love Is"
"State-sanctioned marriage is a civil contract, period. A contract is not a judgment of moral value.

It is not a religious act or rite and so has nothing to do with Adam and Eve or Steve or even Harvey.",Harvey Fierstein,"Legal, Value, Nothing"
"Ultimately, I believe the only secret to a happy marriage is choosing the right person. Life is a series of choices, right?",Michelle Pfeiffer,"Life, Believe, Right Person"

We have our disagreements, but that comes along with marriage.",Tamera Mowry,"Best, God, Family"

"Especially around Valentine's Day, it's easy to find advice about sustaining a successful marriage, with suggestions for 'date nights' and romantic dinners for two.

"Gay marriage is absolutely something that I am in full support of and a big advocate of, and I think it's an important issue, but there's a reason that I don't talk about politics and why I'll never be in politics. I am not the person to ever do that.",Jamie-Lynn Sigler,"Politics, I Am, Gay"
"Gay marriage will be universally accepted in time. But if I may be so bold as to say to gays and lesbians, don't wait for that time to arrive.

The secret to a long marriage is to stay gone.,Dolly Parton,"Long, Stay, Secret"

Which is not a guarantee of perfection - far from it.",Marjorie Liu,"Life, Faith, Relationship"

"With the notion of marriage - an exclusive, emotional, binding 'til death do you part' tie - becoming more and more an exception to the rule given a rise in cohabitation and high rates of divorce, why should the federal government be telling adults who love one another that they cannot get married simply because they happen to be gay?",Lisa Murkowski,"Love, Death, Government"

Marriage is miserable unless you find the right person that is your soulmate and that takes a lot of looking.,Marvin Gaye,"Your, Right Person, Find"

For me, my family is my life.",Kajol,"Life, Work, Change"
"I don't have this fantasy about marriage anymore. Everyone says it takes hard work. Well, it kind of does - and I'm much more pragmatic about romance than I used to be.",Jennifer Garner,"Work, Hard Work, Fantasy"
We're so immaturely cynical as a culture. We're not wise enough to look at an institution like marriage and to really things about what it means and what it signifies. It signifies a place where people can tie the ropes of their lives together so that they're stronger. It signifies a place where people can tell the truth to one another.,Jordan Peterson,"Truth, Wise, Culture"

"As marriage and the family institution constitute the foundation and chief cornerstone of civil society, it is of the greatest moment that the marriage-tie should never be dissolved save for the most urgent reason.

"How lucky are we to have Naomi Watts and Sean Penn playing us? We've seen the final cut now a couple times, and the scenes with the marriage fraying at the edges are still very difficult to watch.

And here we are, 10 years later, making it legal.",Martina Navratilova,"Time, Legal, Gay"
