"Good buildings come from good people, and all problems are solved by good design.",Stephen Gardiner,"Good, Architecture, Problems"

"I look at graphic design as communication, meaning that the work has to have a vibe to connect to the viewer or perceiver.

"The craftless anarchy of the Beat poets on the one hand, and the extreme control of Henry James on the other, suggest that for most human beings, just as both freedom and discipline are necessary in life, serendipity and design must coexist in a work to make it readable.",Mark Helprin,"Life, Work, Freedom"
Good design should be available to everyone - and I do mean everyone. What I spent on the wheelchair I'm in could buy a small Mercedes. It's not only unfair to me; it's unfair to someone who's indigent but has the same needs. My goal is to make all objects affordable.,Michael Graves,"Good, Me, Mercedes"
"I don't like the collusion between high fashion design and high street. You have to know where you stand. I belong to luxury fashion. That's what I've always felt and embraced.

The broader one's understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.",Steve Jobs,"Experience, Better, Will"
"People tell you the world looks a certain way. Parents tell you how to think. Schools tell you how to think. TV. Religion.

"Design helps shape our everyday interactions through products, furniture, objects, or experiences.",Joe Gebbia,"Furniture, Shape, Through"

"The genome was once thought to be just the blueprint for a living organism, like a combination of the architect's plan for a building and the builder's list of supplies.

"Integrating breakthrough technology into everyday products is always a challenge; at the same time, this is exactly how design makes tech products easily adoptable in life.",Yves Behar,"Life, Technology, Time"

"The principle of the design - the harmony, rhythm and balance are all the same with interior and fashion design.",Venus Williams,"Balance, Harmony, Fashion"
"To design is much more than simply to assemble, to order, or even to edit: it is to add value and meaning, to illuminate, to simplify, to clarify, to modify, to dignify, to dramatize, to persuade, and perhaps even to amuse. To design is to transform prose into poetry.",Paul Rand,"Poetry, Value, Meaning"
"Good design begins with honesty, asks tough questions, comes from collaboration and from trusting your intuition.",Freeman Thomas,"Good, Your, Honesty"
Good design to me is both appearance and functionality together. It's the experience that makes it good design.,Michael Graves,"Good, Experience, Together"
"People say I am the king of painful shoes. I don't want to create painful shoes, but it is not my job to create something comfortable.

"Design should not dominate things, should not dominate people. It should help people. That's its role.",Dieter Rams,"People, Help, Things"

Design our world so that we have positive social and environmental side effects.,Bjarke Ingels,"Positive, Environmental, World"

"I'm not a mother of children, but I'm a different type of mother where my approach to design is more in line with nature. It's less about dictating and more about editing and listening and allowing something to grow. So I nourish and let the material express what it wants to be.",Neri Oxman,"Nature, Editing, Grow"
"By the late Nineties, we had become a more visual nation. Big-money taste moved to global standards - new architecture, design and show-off contemporary art. The Sloane domestic aesthetic - symmetry, class symbolism and brown furniture - became as unfashionable as it had been hot in the early Eighties.",Peter York,"Art, Architecture, New"
"Advertising is, of course, important because advertise is the final design. It's the last layer that speaks to the customer, that tells them what you have.",Tom Ford,"Important, Advertising, Last"

"When I design and wonder what the point is, I think of someone having a bad time in their life.

But only a little.",Miuccia Prada,"Life, Sad, Time"
I call my design style rustically modern. I like to take traditional or rustic features and fuse it into a more modern design.,Drew Scott,"Style, More, Rustic"
"At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production. Assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts, framing the imagination of designers and architects who have been trained to think about their objects as assemblies of discrete parts with distinct functions.",Neri Oxman,"Imagination, Industrial Revolution, Who"
"A true flag is not something you can really design. A true flag is torn from the soul of the people. A flag is something that everyone owns, and that's why they work. The Rainbow Flag is like other flags in that sense: it belongs to the people.",Gilbert Baker,"Work, Soul, Rainbow"
Often the most important moment in the design process is figuring out what the right question is.,Thomas Heatherwick,"Moment, Process, Important"
"To design the future effectively, you must first let go of your past.",Charles J. Givens,"Success, Future, Your"

"This is very much my philosophy as a fashion designer. I have never believed in design for design's sake. For me, the most important thing is that people actually wear my clothes. I do not design for the catwalk or for magazine shoots - I design for customers.",Giorgio Armani,"Me, Important, Clothes"
"When your arms are out wide, you'll capture love and joy and golden moments but other things, too. Mistrust will sneak in on a wave of that joy, and complications will ride the backs of the golden moments, and there will be both love and the risks of love. That's the way it is. That's the design.",Deb Caletti,"Love, Risks, Your"
"The French, whose fascination with 19th-century Japanese painting and decorative art led them to coin the term 'Japonisme,' have reciprocated the interest, and the exchange - in food, fashion and design - is ongoing. After all, these are two countries where style is considered essential to life.",Thomas Chatterton Williams,"Life, Art, Food"
The only important thing about design is how it relates to people.,Victor Papanek,"Important, People, Only"

"A lot of people don't get it, but I design from the inside out so that the finished product looks inevitable somehow. I think it's important to create spaces that people like to be in, that are humanistic.",Frank Gehry,"Important, People, Create"
The illusion of purpose and design is perhaps the most pervasive illusion about nature that science has to confront on a daily basis.,Lawrence M. Krauss,"Science, Nature, Daily"
I've never had anyone define purity. You probably can't define purity. Purity is to live according to original design.,Josh McDowell,"Never, Live, Purity"
"Great design is so many things all at the same time. It is emotional, functional, and responsive. It creates an unwritten dialogue, a connection, between itself and those who experience it. It is open to interpretation yet created for a specific purpose. It creates meaning and value.",Marcel Wanders,"Experience, Time, Great"
"I read a newspaper article in May 1984 which predicted that syringes would one day be a major cause of the transmission of HIV. It was what I had been waiting for - a project that had a lot of the things that I liked: problem-solving, product design, campaigning, and being a bit of a big mouth pain-in-the-bum.",Marc Koska,"Waiting, Day, Newspaper"
"There is not necessarily a good reason why a regulator should have to be involved in product design and marketing for rich and sophisticated investors. We recommend that such investors should be able to sign a piece of paper, which allows them to go ahead and buy unregulated products at their own risk.",John Redwood,"Good, Rich, Ahead"
"To me, form doesn't always follow function. Form has a life of its own, and at times, it may be the motivating force in design. When you're dealing with form as a sculptor, you feel that you are quite free in attempting to mould and shape things you want to do, but in architecture, it's much more difficult because it has to have a function.",I. M. Pei,"Life, Architecture, Always"
"Good design keeps the user happy, the manufacturer in the black and the aesthete unoffended.",Raymond Loewy,"Good, Black, Happy"
"In the design process, there's a need to be culturally comprehensive.",Dries van Noten,"Process, Need, Comprehensive"
I am equally proud of all of my architectural projects. It's always rewarding to see an ambitious design become reality.,Zaha Hadid,"Always, Reality, I Am"
It is sad that so many designers don't know how to make. CAD software can make a bad design look palatable! It is sad that four years can be spent on a 3D design course without making anything! People who are great at designing and making have a great advantage.,Jonathan Ive,"Sad, Great, Look"
"By design, Bitcoin is a scarce resource with a predictable supply of new issuance. And it is this scarcity and predictable supply that make it so attractive as an underlying asset to bind to economic activity and trade.",Jeremy Allaire,"Bitcoin, New, Attractive"
"Computers are scary. They're nightmares to fix, lose our stuff, and, on occasion, they crash, producing the blue screen of death. Steve Jobs knew this. He knew that computers were bulky and hernia-inducing and Darth Vader black. He understood the value of declarative design.",Wesley Morris,"Death, Computers, Value"
"People say I design architectural icons. If I design a building and it becomes an icon, that's ok.",Zaha Hadid,"People, Building, People Say"

Successful design is not the achievement of perfection but the minimization and accommodation of imperfection.,Henry Petroski,"Perfection, Achievement, Imperfection"

"I had given a presentation on design and happiness for quite a long while at design conferences. I had found thinking about the topic helpful for my own practice, as it forced me to consider the fundamentals, and the feedback from the audience was always enthusiastic.",Stefan Sagmeister,"Happiness, Always, Long"
"Everything else - music, cinematography, costumes, design, acting - can be judged at face value. But when you're looking at editing, you don't know what the totality of the material was, and you don't know the working dynamic between a director and an editor - whether the editor was micromanaged or given free rein. It's very difficult.",Christopher Rouse,"Music, Value, Face"

Interior design is a business of trust.,Venus Williams,"Trust, Business, Interior"
"I got to train with some of the best and have critics like Oscar de la Renta and Calvin Klein. As a student under Calvin Klein, my project was to make a coat, and then years later, I was hired at Calvin, by Calvin, to design coats for him. It came full circle!",Narciso Rodriguez,"Best, Circle, Make"
"I don't believe in planning for things. I just want them to fall in place, unfold as they like. I never design things. I want films to choose me; I don't choose films.",Pawan Kalyan,"Believe, Me, Fall"
My graphic design skills are superior to a lot of other things I can do; I use it as a part of my tool kit.,Virgil Abloh,"I Can, Skills, Things"

"If we want users to like our software, we should design it to behave like a likeable person.",Alan Cooper,"Person, Software, Behave"

"To be sure, many of the Sykes-Picot borders reflected deals cut in Europe rather than local demographic or historical realities. But that hardly makes the Middle East unique: Most borders around the world owe their legacy less to thoughtful design or popular choice than to some mixture of violence, ambition, geography, and chance.",Richard N. Haass,"Chance, Legacy, World"
"My background was in graphic design, but when I was doing it, it was all hand-drawn stuff, not computers.",Jeffrey Dean Morgan,"Computers, Doing, Background"
"I hate going out for lunch during a workday because it slows down my pace and ruins my rhythm. I prefer to eat at my desk. Actually, I wander around the design studio with a plate in my hand as I dine on, for example, salmon sashimi and a salad of tomatoes and mozzarella. I often have a bit of dark chocolate after lunch.",Tom Ford,"Hate, Lunch, Salad"
"Apart from differentiating our spaces with design, we also look for buildings that have distinctive character. We make sure every seat is a good one.",Miguel McKelvey,"Good, Character, Look"

"When the Great Fire of London destroyed most of the medieval city in 1666, Christopher Wren was invited to design a new one.

"Design must be functional, and functionality must be translated into visual aesthetics without any reliance on gimmicks that have to be explained.",Ferdinand Porsche,"Visual, Must, Explained"

"So if I design it and then go away, it's still living somewhere and it still exists by itself without me.",Marc Newson,"Me, Living, Go"

The essence of the iMac is to be the finest possible consumer computer in which each element plays together.,Steve Jobs,"Computers, Together, Soul"

"For all the drama we all have with our families and all the tension and hostility, I couldn't have done this without my family. Being the people that they are - they're crazy - made it possible for me to be crazy and to live a lifestyle of my own design.",Dan Colen,"Family, Done, Me"
People believe the only alternative to randomness is intelligent design.,Richard Dawkins,"Believe, People, Randomness"

"My design preference tends towards warmth, comfort, and minimalism.",Gauri Khan,"Comfort, Warmth, Preference"
"Whether one believes in evolution, intelligent design, or Divine Creation, one thing is certain.

And no civilization has ever willingly given up its most powerful weapons.",Mohamed ElBaradei,"History, War, Religion"
"The wisdom of crowds works when the crowd is choosing the price of an ox, when there's a single numeric average.

You want people and groups who are able to think thoughts before they share.",Jaron Lanier,"Wisdom, Thoughts, Decision"
"Graphic Design, which fulfills aesthetic needs, complies with the laws of form and exigencies of two-dimensional space; which speaks in semiotics, sans-serifs, and geometrics; which abstracts, transforms, translates, rotates, dilates, repeats, mirrors, groups, and regroups, is not good design if it is irrelevant.",Paul Rand,"Good, Space, Aesthetic"
"Everything we do is designed, whether we're producing a magazine, a website, or a bridge. Design is really the creative invention that designs everything.",Henry Petroski,"Bridge, Website, Everything"
"The computer can't tell you the emotional story. It can give you the exact mathematical design, but what's missing is the eyebrows.",Frank Zappa,"Story, Tell, Missing"
While I was at college studying design I decided to paint. I was also greatly inspired by the colours that I had seen on my travels in the Brazilian Rain forest.,John Dyer,"Rain, Forest, College"
"Function is fundamental to design, of course. If something doesn't work, it's a bad product, and I certainly get frustrated by things that aren't functional. But there has to be more than function. A house has to function, but if that's all it does, you don't love it.",Marcel Wanders,"Love, Work, Bad"

I try to push design boundaries using new draping and fabric manipulation techniques every time I approach a new design.,Zac Posen,"Time, Try, New"

I would love to be an imagineer!",Roman Coppola,"Love, Work, Waiting"

"When I studied graphic design, I learned a valuable lesson: There's no perfect answer to the puzzle, and creativity is a renewable resource.",Biz Stone,"Puzzle, Creativity, Perfect"

"My guilty pleasure is I like to watch a lot of HGTV. I really like watching design shows about houses, like extreme homes. Like buying a bridge and turning it into a house or something like that. I really am interested in home design or something like that... architecture.",Taylor Schilling,"Home, Architecture, Bridge"
"I really love muscle cars. I don't think people might realize that about me. I really want to go to an auto auction and blow my life savings on a Camaro. They have such design around them, such panache.",Alex Guarnaschelli,"Life, Love, Me"
"I think every business, really, has a unique reason for being, unique assets, unique attributes, a unique history. And that can be turned into a very attractive design story, essentially, that consumers can relate to.",Yves Behar,"History, Business, Unique"
Fear is present when we forget that we are a part of God's divine design.

You can make the decision to be free from fear and doubt and return to the brilliant light of love that is always with you.,Wayne Dyer,"Love, God, Experience"
"The maker movement is about people who want to gain more control of the human design world that they interact with every day.

"Data and data sets are not objective; they are creations of human design. We give numbers their voice, draw inferences from them, and define their meaning through our interpretations.",Kate Crawford,"Voice, Numbers, Human"
"There is always going to be that luxury customer out there. I have clients who buy $10,000 dresses and clients who buy $60 dresses. It's not so much about the money. Design is a mentality.",Jason Wu,"Money, Always, Luxury"
"I grew up in Northern California on the peninsula. It was a beautiful house, but it was very traditional. It wasn't midcentury modern. I'm talking 1970s, early '80s - design didn't even go 'Wall Street' until, like, 1986.",Eric Dane,"Beautiful, Street, Go"
"I love HGTV. I love working on my house and have really been bit by the 'luxury remodeling' bug. 'Million Dollar Rooms,' 'Million Dollar Listing'... any show that can give me design inspiration, I soak it in and try my hand at it. Home Depot is my second home!",Laz Alonso,"Love, Home, Me"

Because what we don't talk about is how the handful of people working at a handful of technology companies through their choices will steer what a billion people are thinking today.",Tristan Harris,"Technology, Today, Thoughts"
"A movie contains literally tens of thousands of ideas. They're in the form of every sentence; in the performance of each line; in the design of characters, sets, and backgrounds; in the locations of the camera; in the colors, the lighting, the pacing.",Edwin Catmull,"Colors, Ideas, Performance"
"When shooting in real spaces, the work of a cinematographer begins where location meets production design meets time of day. No movie light will ever look as real as the sun, so scheduling becomes truly paramount to naturalistic lighting.",Rachel Morrison,"Work, Time, Light"
"Growing up, Guess always had these amazing billboards and cool affordable clothing. I wore it then, and I still wear it now! It's come full-circle. When I design the clothes, I have a very good team around me, showing me different pieces and cuts.",Tiesto,"Good, Cool, Amazing"

"In software design, it's all about making a guess, trying it, and then learning from the experience.",Stewart Butterfield,"Experience, Learning, Trying"

"I am always looking for ways to move technology away from being over-featured. Moving to Silicon Valley in the mid-1990s meant I grew up as a designer in an environment where technology is a tool and not a means to an end.

"I always take care to have interesting chord progressions, because you can have the best sound design in the club, and you'll kill it in the club, but in five years, kids will have better sound design.

"There's a fun, nostalgic aspect to Legos - people connect to the art on a different level. But it's also a medium that lets me design anything I can imagine.

"A big part of the fun of working on Superman has been coming up with new characters and concepts to toss in, helping to design their costumes, things like that.

"I'm constantly thinking about design, shapes, patterns and colors, so I just want to be more of a blank canvas. But there is a comfort in knowing what you're going to wear, and that probably comes from Catholic school, where I wore a uniform for 10 years.",Prabal Gurung,"Comfort, Colors, Thinking"

"I am interested in all aspects of filmmaking, so I have an opinion on every aspect, so sound design, score, cinematography, editing - all that stuff I have experience doing myself, so I had a very strong idea of what I wanted, and I got, for the most part, people that were able to articulate that idea, which was nice.",Jeff Baena,"Experience, Myself, Editing"

I have always been fascinated by Shaker design and the culture of the Shakers.,Ken Hakuta,"Always, Culture, Been"

Sometimes living in a room that's badly designed isn't the worst thing in the world. Trust me - this is a fact! Living in a room that has no design whatsoever is even worse.

Organisms by their design are not made to adapt too far.,Kevin Kelly,"Adapt, Far, Made"
"In our interconnected world, novel technology could empower just one fanatic, or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses, to trigger some kind of disaster.

"I came down successfully through Picasso and Braque, down through Pollock, I guess, but I began to stop at Franz Kline and the Abstractionists.

Flying through a hurricane is the most fearsome shaking you will ever get. Everything has to be tied down in the airplane. And the IMAX camera has to be rock-steady through all this.

"Year after year, animal print, hides, fur, tusks et al find their way into the home as design elements in various spaces; not surprising, considering that the use of 'animalia' as decor in the home dates back centuries, when, to be fair, they didn't have the choice of faux and tended to eat the animals as well as enjoy their pelts.",Hilary Farr,"Home, Way, Find"

"You can really have a no-holds-barred relationship to materials with mixed metals and colorful schemes or more controlled palettes that are more tonal or restricted to a single accent color or metal finish. There are really no rules, and that is what makes contemporary design so limitless and enjoyable.",Bobby Berk,"Relationship, Rules, Colorful"
"I've always known I wanted to be in design somehow. It was going to be architecture, but I would've had to quit acting for it. I realized with horology, I could learn at my own pace.",Aldis Hodge,"Architecture, Always, Own"

"I have a brilliant sound design team who's been working with me since 'Mr. Robot,' and one of the things we always think about - and it's also something we think about with cinematography - is how we get inside the characters' heads and how do we place the audience where we want them to be or how we want them to feel at any given moment.",Sam Esmail,"Always, Moment, Me"
"NPR editors and journalists found themselves caught in a game of trying to please a leadership team who did not want to hear stories on the air about conservatives, the poor, or anyone who didn't fit their profitable design of NPR as the official voice of college-educated, white, liberal-leaning, upper-income America.",Juan Williams,"Leadership, Game, Voice"

"I went through the workroom at Central Saint Martins in London, which is the most competitive workroom of a design school in the world.

"There are many designers who have much greater talent as a designer than I do, but they may not have my drive, they may not work as hard, they may not have the focus, the desire...

They want to talk about them.",Seph Lawless,"Beauty, Work, Nature"
"I'm involved in everything from highly progressive lighting systems to airline interiors.
