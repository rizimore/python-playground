So when we look at the night sky, it makes sense that someone is looking back at us.",Michio Kaku,"Sky, Stars, Looking Back"
"Whenever I gaze up at the moon, I feel like I'm on a time machine. I am back to that precious pinpoint of time, standing on the foreboding - yet beautiful - Sea of Tranquility. I could see our shining blue planet Earth poised in the darkness of space.",Buzz Aldrin,"Time, Beautiful, Moon"

"The stars look the same from night to night. Nebulae and galaxies are dully immutable, maintaining the same overall appearance for thousands or millions of years. Indeed, only the sun, moon and planets - together with the occasional comet, asteroid or meteor - seem dynamic.",Seth Shostak,"Together, Stars, Moon"

The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.,Nikola Tesla,"Me, Feeling, First"
"Each year, thousands of UFOs are sighted and reported, which is an impressive tally of unidentified aerial phenomena.

"Supplying fuel for a Mars expedition from the lunar surface is often suggested, but it's hard to make it pay off - Moon bases are expensive, and just buying more rockets to launch fuel from Earth is relatively cheap.",Henry Spencer,"Moon, Mars, Earth"
"Sometimes people ask me how difficult the astronaut program was, but being in Sierra Leone, being responsible for the health of more than 200 people, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, at age 26 - that prepared me to take on a lot of different challenges.",Mae Jemison,"Health, Age, Day"
I've been lucky enough to fly to space twice.,Chris Hadfield,"Fly, Enough, Lucky"
"The earth together with its surrounding waters must in fact have such a shape as its shadow reveals, for it eclipses the moon with the arc of a perfect circle.",Nicolaus Copernicus,"Shadow, Together, Moon"
"On Earth, men and women are taking the same risks. Why shouldn't we be taking the same risks in space?",Valentina Tereshkova,"Women, Men, Risks"

What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that men set foot on the moon but that they set eye on the earth.,Norman Cousins,"Men, Moon, Earth"
"The rockets and the satellites, spaceships that we're creating now, we're pollinating the universe.",Neil Young,"Universe, Creating, Now"
"Everything has a natural explanation. The moon is not a god, but a great rock, and the sun a hot rock.",Anaxagoras,"God, Great, Moon"

"By refocusing our space program on Mars for America's future, we can restore the sense of wonder and adventure in space exploration that we knew in the summer of 1969. We won the moon race; now it's time for us to live and work on Mars, first on its moons and then on its surface.",Buzz Aldrin,"Work, Future, Time"

"Houston, we've had a problem.",Jim Lovell,"Problem, Houston, Had"
"The math is dead simple: it seems that the frequency of planets able to support life is roughly one percent. In other words, a billion or more such worlds exist in our galaxy alone. That's a lot of acreage, and it takes industrial-strength credulity to believe it's all bleakly barren.",Seth Shostak,"Life, Alone, Believe"
"Most of our history in space has been communicated in terms of action - what people do, a chronological list of events which have transpired - as opposed to the human experience of having done those things.",Story Musgrave,"History, Experience, Done"
"As a young boy growing up in rural India, most of what I knew of the world was what I could see around me.

"The question we ask is - if there is life on other planets, should we expect it to be based on the same molecules, i.e. be universal - or should we expect it to depend on the local conditions, i.e. on the planet's geochemistry. So to find out, we try experiments on biomolecules, starting with such geochemistry conditions.",Dimitar Sasselov,"Life, Try, Find"

"Space offers extraordinary potential for commerce and adventure, for new innovations and new tests of will. As Americans, we can't help but reach for the stars. It's our nature. It's our destiny.",Bill Frist,"Nature, Stars, Destiny"
Why is there space rather than no space? Why is space three-dimensional? Why is space big? We have a lot of room to move around in. How come it's not tiny? We have no consensus about these things. We're still exploring them.,Leonard Susskind,"Room, Why, Things"
"I'll tell you, being involved in human space flight, it is an emotional endeavor. I think it brings in the highest highs and the lowest lows.",Ellen Ochoa,"Human, Tell, Flight"

"Perhaps, as some wit remarked, the best proof that there is Intelligent Life in Outer Space is the fact it hasn't come here. Well, it can't hide forever - one day we will overhear it.",Arthur C. Clarke,"Life, Best, Day"
"Life can be less mysterious than we make it out to be when we try to think about how it would be on other planets. And if we remove the mystery of life, then I think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live, and how perhaps we're not as special as we always think we are.",Chris Adami,"Life, Always, Mystery"
I stayed in the astronaut program until 1993. People ask me why I left. I thought I had a lot of things to contribute that would be difficult to do if I stayed.

I believe that there may be intelligent life on other planets.,Pat Buckley,"Life, Believe, I Believe That"
"Space travel is the only technology that is more dangerous and more expensive now than it was in its first year.

"If we ever start communicating with living creatures from other planets, the number one priority is, how are you going to communicate information? Even between different cultures here on Earth, you get into communication problems.",Story Musgrave,"Communication, Problems, Information"
"During launch, the outside of the rocket is covered in a protective fairing, so we couldn't see outside, but as soon as that was jettisoned, my first view of the earth was over the Pacific Ocean, which was this wonderful deep blue, with clouds just over the top, and sunlight streaming in through the window.",Helen Sharman,"Clouds, Window, View"

"There are thousands of asteroids whose orbit in the Solar System crosses that of Earth. And we have a little acronym for them - NEOs: near Earth objects. And our biggest goal is to try to catalogue them, so we know in advance if one is going to put us at risk.",Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Try, Know, Earth"
"The photographs of space taken by our astronauts have been published all over the place. But the eye is a much more dynamic mechanism than any camera or pictures.

Of course, I personally am sick and tired of hearing people talk like that: I want to see it myself!",Burt Rutan,"Myself, Tired, View"
"It's very dangerous to put astronauts on a moon base where there's radiation, solar flares and micro meteorites. It'd be much better to put robots on the moon and have them mentally connected to astronauts on the Earth.",Michio Kaku,"Moon, Better, Robots"
"Life science research can be done on multiple platforms. Since we have a very small number of people flying into space, the more people you have, the better.",Laurel Clark,"Life, Science, Done"

"I watched the moon landing as a boy, and I thought that was the most exciting thing ever, going into space, orbiting Earth and exploring other planets. That looked fantastic.",David Mackay,"Moon, Earth, Boy"
"Our astronauts, when they go orbiting around the earth, they actually come back slightly younger than a twin that they would have on the planet Earth who was stationary. This is called the twin paradox.",Michio Kaku,"Earth, Go, Back"
"The lunar flights give you a correct perception of our existence. You look back at Earth from the moon, and you can put your thumb up to the window and hide the Earth behind your thumb. Everything you've ever known is behind your thumb, and that blue-and-white ball is orbiting a rather normal star, tucked away on the outer edge of a galaxy.",Jim Lovell,"Your, Window, Moon"
"Sometimes people wonder why aeroplanes are so cheap and rockets are so expensive. Even the most superficial comparison shows one obvious difference: aeroplane engines use outside air to burn their fuel, while rockets have to carry their own oxidisers along.",Henry Spencer,"Burn, Own, People"
"One of the things that we can say with confidence is that we will have much lighter, much stronger materials, and this will reduce the cost of air flight, and the cost of rockets.",Ralph Merkle,"Confidence, Will, Air"

Rocket scientists agree that we have about reached the limit of our ability to travel in space using chemical rockets. To achieve anything near the speed of light we will need a new energy source and a new propellant. Nuclear fission is not an option.,Wilson Greatbatch,"Travel, Light, Energy"
"The images of Earth's delicate biosphere, contrasting with the sterile moonscape where the astronauts left their footsteps, have become iconic for environmentalists: these may indeed be the Apollo programme's most enduring legacy.",Martin Rees,"Legacy, Earth, May"
"We have never observed infinity in nature. Whenever you have infinities in a theory, that's where the theory fails as a description of nature. And if space was born in the Big Bang, yet is infinite now, we are forced to believe that it's instantaneously, infinitely big. It seems absurd.",Janna Levin,"Nature, Believe, Born"
"I do not remember how it got into my head to make the first calculations related to rocket. It seems to me the first seeds were planted by famous fantaseour, J. Verne.",Konstantin Tsiolkovsky,"Famous, Remember, Me"
"For a long time, we've worked on detecting planets with whatever was at hand, making use of existing small telescopes or even amateur telescopes. It's time to move on to the next stage.",Andrew Gould,"Time, Long, Long Time"
"We've been surrounded by images of space our whole lives, from the speculative images of science fiction to the inspirational visions of artists to the increasingly beautiful pictures made possible by complex technologies. But whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space, we have no sense of what space sounds like.",Honor Harger,"Inspirational, Science, Beautiful"
"Put two ships in the open sea, without wind or tide, and, at last, they will come together. Throw two planets into space, and they will fall one on the other. Place two enemies in the midst of a crowd, and they will inevitably meet; it is a fatality, a question of time; that is all.",Jules Verne,"Time, Together, Wind"
"You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door on the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on it. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space.",Johnny Cash,"Failure, Time, Moving On"
"If your ego starts out, 'I am important, I am big, I am special,' you're in for some disappointments when you look around at what we've discovered about the universe. No, you're not big. No, you're not. You're small in time and in space. And you have this frail vessel called the human body that's limited on Earth.",Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Attitude, Time, Your"
"I believe in Liberty for all men: the space to stretch their arms and their souls, the right to breathe and the right to vote, the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine, and ride on the railroads, uncursed by color; thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a kingdom of beauty and love.",W. E. B. Du Bois,"Love, Beauty, Freedom"

Competitive golf is played mainly on a five-and-a-half-inch course... the space between your ears.,Bobby Jones,"Your, Golf, Competitive"
"Technology is supposed to make our lives easier, allowing us to do things more quickly and efficiently.

"I have values. But morals are Christian. There's no religion here. Values. Don't hurt when you don't need to, but don't let anybody step over that line - it's an invisible line, but it's respect for somebody's space.",John Lydon,"Respect, Religion, Step"
"A just laicism allows religious freedom. The state does not impose religion but rather gives space to religions with a responsibility toward civil society, and therefore it allows these religions to be factors in building up society.",Pope Benedict XVI,"Freedom, Society, Religion"

You know, the sky's the limit with this thing, and I'm still making it up as I go along.",John Polson,"Best, Great, Sky"
"The greatest propaganda coup of the American Right has been to convince its citizens that we are in the grip of a liberal conspiracy.

And we, VICE, aim to exploit it.",Shane Smith,"Believe, Aim, Result"
"We are bombarded on all sides by a vast number of messages we don't want or need. More information is generated in a single day than we can absorb in a lifetime. To fully enjoy life, all of us must find our own breathing space and peace of mind.",James E. Faust,"Life, Peace, Day"
Rhythm is the life of space of time danced through.,Cecil Taylor,"Life, Time, Rhythm"
"Something I like to do a lot is just sit by water when there's a current and just stare into the water.

"I think 'Lost in Space' certainly shifted from being an ensemble adventure series about a family facing the unknown alien environment to this trio of comedians - Dr. Smith, the Robot, and Will Robinson being the straight guy. It definitely changed its tone over the three seasons and 84 episodes we did.",Bill Mumy,"Family, Lost, Will"
"Trees bear fruits only to be eaten by others; the fields grown grains, but they are consumed by the world. Cows give milk, but she doesn't drink it herself - that is left to others.

"I'm an artiste... I dance, I act, and I do a lot of things that's got to do with arts, and that's my space. I feel happiest in that space.",Nora Fatehi,"Dance, Feel, Act"
"I think maths is the root of everything. If we understood every area of math, it would lead to improving our sense of science, physics, engineering, space travel... all those great things. Maths is a backbone for it.",Matt Haig,"Science, Great, Travel"
"On the whole, books are indeed less finite than ourselves. Even the worst among them outlast their authors - mainly because they occupy a smaller amount of physical space than those who penned them.

"Geez, all that money we waste on space exploration; just think how many bombs that would buy!",Craig Bruce,"Money, Exploration, Space Exploration"

"Bumble is all about community and safe, empowered connections, and the Hive represents a natural extension of our brand and our values.

"Chernobyl happened in April of 1986. A few months earlier, in January 1986, the Challenger space shuttle exploded.

"In an enclosed space, a camel's breath can change the atmosphere of the room. Not only just the smell, they literally seem to change the atmospheric pressure. It's so disgusting.

"Comics have a problem, and that is continuity - the obsession with placing the characters in an existing world, where every event is marked in canon.

"I believe that architecture, as anything else in life, is evolutionary. Ideas evolve; they don't come from outer space and crash into the drawing board.",Bjarke Ingels,"Life, Architecture, Believe"

"Prison is essentially a shortage of space made up for by a surplus of time; to an inmate, both are palpable.",Joseph Brodsky,"Time, Prison, Up"

Your sacred space is where you can find yourself again and again.,Joseph Campbell,"Wisdom, Your, Yourself"
"The basic thing you have to understand is everything that happens on that spaceship, from the time you crawl into that seat to the time it touches down, is controlled from the ground.

"Some people say they feel very small when they think about space. I felt more expansive, very connected to the universe.",Mae Jemison,"Universe, Feel, People"
"The thing for me is that 'Thor' was an indie film that just had a few more zeros on the budget. At heart, it is just a simple story about a guy trying to get home to deal with someone who has broken into his house. It's just 'After Hours,' but set in space.",Taika Waititi,"Home, Heart, Simple"
"I don't think I'm the world's most die-hard sci-fi fan, but I definitely grew up watching 'Star Trek' religiously - all of them: the original, 'Next Generation,' 'Deep Space Nine,' 'Voyager.'

"In an endless jungle of websites with text-based content, a beautiful image with a lot of space and colour can be like walking into a clearing. It's a relief.",David McCandless,"Beautiful, Jungle, Walking"

"You can binge a TV series or watch a reality show, and they're not innocent. They take a lot of room in your brain, and you don't have any space left for your own thoughts. They give you a scripted reality. It's an ideological tool.",Raoul Peck,"Brain, Thoughts, Your"

"The music comes through me, and I let it come the way it comes, and it shapes itself. I just hold space for it.

"I think even in bad times it's good to keep some money going into research. And that's the purpose of the whole space program.

"Graphic Design, which fulfills aesthetic needs, complies with the laws of form and exigencies of two-dimensional space; which speaks in semiotics, sans-serifs, and geometrics; which abstracts, transforms, translates, rotates, dilates, repeats, mirrors, groups, and regroups, is not good design if it is irrelevant.",Paul Rand,"Design, Good, Aesthetic"
"Starbucks was founded around the experience and the environment of their stores.

"We never had books at home, but my dad, seeing how keen I was to read, took me to Islington Library when I was about eight and we pulled out two - a Biggles and a science fiction novel.

"I started playing the guitar when we started filming the pilot to 'Lost in Space,' which was way back in December of 1964, and there's a little bit in the pilot that was used in the first season where Will Robinson is sitting around some bad foam rubber rock playing and singing 'Greensleeves.'",Bill Mumy,"Guitar, Lost, Will"

"Two subsequent incidents of import established CNN: the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986, which CNN was the only network to cover as it happened, and the 1991 Gulf War, which CNN chronicled round the clock from a proximity as irresistible as it was alarming, bomb blasts and gunfire lighting up TV screens from coast to coast.",Steve Erickson,"War, Clock, Only"
"The most important part of my work on The Orion Building was the creation within the apartments of living space which inspires people and the way they live their lives, whether they have bought a one-bedroom apartment or the penthouse.

"When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors.

"The first news event I understood as a small child was the loss of the space shuttle Challenger, which President Reagan eloquently mourned from the Oval that evening.",Pete Buttigieg,"Evening, News, First"

"The body moves through space every day, and in architecture in cities that can be orchestrated.

"We should've asked China to be a portion of the space station. We should've worked out ways that we can... just give away the technology that we have that puts things up into space, with cooperation up above the atmosphere that's needed to help each other.",Buzz Aldrin,"Technology, Help, Things"
"It's true that I love to connect with my fans on the social networking sites, but I try not to go overboard, ever. I just give people a peek into my mind space, but never bombard them with my tweets.",A. R. Rahman,"Love, Mind, Try"
"Just to continue a space program because it's a space program? No, I don't think we have an obligation for that.",John Glenn,"Continue, Think, Obligation"
"The characteristic of great innovators and great companies is they see a space that others do not. They don't just listen to what people tell them; they actually invent something new, something that you didn't know you needed, but the moment you see it, you say, 'I must have it.'",Eric Schmidt,"Business, Great, Moment"
Not everyone is lucky enough to be given space and trust.,Vanessa Paradis,"Trust, Enough, Everyone"
"Perhaps future space probes will be plastered in commercial logos, just as Formula One cars are now. Perhaps Robot Wars in space will be a lucrative spectator sport. If humans venture back to the moon, and even beyond, they may carry commercial insignia rather than national flags.",Martin Rees,"Future, Moon, Will"
A piazza is not a plaza. The plaza is the theme park of the piazza; the plaza is the commercial version. A piazza is an empty space with no function. This is what Europeans understand.,Renzo Piano,"Understand, Theme, Empty"
"Space is tight inside a tank: very close confines, and you're permanently banging. Like in Brad Pitt's new movie 'Fury' - the clanking of metal is all you hear.",James Blunt,"New, Inside, Hear"
"Dichotomies are an inherent part of comics, aren't they? Comics are both pictures and words. They blend time and space. Many feature characters with dual identities like Bruce Wayne/Batman. Cartoonists also tend to live dichotomous lives because many of us have day jobs.",Gene Luen Yang,"Time, Day, Words"
The thought of a limit to perceptual space and time staggers the mind.,Muhammad Iqbal,"Time, Mind, Limit"
"The only routine I have is going for a run and a swim with the dog in the morning, between 8am and 9am - that is my head-clearing space. I am religious about holding on to that time: whatever happens, I don't want to know about it until after that.",Emily Maitlis,"Morning, Time, I Am"
"As a kid, I was obsessed with space. Well, I was obsessed with nuclear science too, to a point, but before that, I was obsessed with space, and I was really excited about, you know, being an astronaut and designing rockets, which was something that was always exciting to me.",Taylor Wilson,"Science, Always, Me"
Designing a station with artificial gravity would undoubtedly be a daunting task. Space agencies would have to re-examine many reliable technologies under the light of the new forces these tools would have to endure. Space flight would have to take several steps back before moving forward again.,Andy Weir,"Light, Moving Forward, New"
"Housework never really bothered me... what bothered me about it later was that it was expected to be your life... when you're a housewife, you are constantly interrupted. You have no space in your life. It isn't the fact that you do the laundry.",Alice Munro,"Life, Your, Me"

I think about the cosmic snowball theory. A few million years from now the sun will burn out and lose its gravitational pull. The earth will turn into a giant snowball and be hurled through space. When that happens it won't matter if I get this guy out.,Bill Lee,"Lose, Sun, Matter"
Space or science fiction has become a dialect for our time.,Doris Lessing,"Science, Time, Science Fiction"
"We call the fates of the Titanic and the Concordia - as well as those of the space shuttles Challenger and Columbia - 'accidents.' Foreseeing such undesirable events is what engineers are expected to do. However, design trade-offs leave technological systems open to failings once predicted, but later forgotten.",Henry Petroski,"Design, Accidents, Open"
"We have spent billions to go to the moon - we go to this lesser satellite called the moon and say we are in space, but we are in space right now; we just don't feel ourselves to be in space. Some forms of art and some forms of spirituality do give us that sense.",James Turrell,"Art, Moon, Feel"
Painting is the most magical of mediums. The transcendence is truly amazing to me every time I go to a museum and I see how somebody figured another way to rub colored dirt on a flat surface and make space where there is no space or make you think of a life experience.,Chuck Close,"Life, Experience, Time"
One of the things I think is really cool that we're testing on board the International Space Station is the water reclamation system.,Peggy Whitson,"Cool, Water, Things"

"We have never lost a crew member on the space station, but of course, the Columbia accident. I was - I'd already been an astronaut for a decade when the crew of Columbia was killed.

"Space is almost infinite. As a matter of fact, we think it is infinite.",Dan Quayle,"Matter, Think, Infinite"

"When buyers see the pride of ownership - when they come in, and they're impressed by how clean the place is - they can picture their kids playing on the floor. They can picture the family sitting around the table. When they can picture their own family in that space, instantly you grab them, and they'll pay more money, too.",Jonathan Scott,"Family, Money, Pride"
"We're all humans living on this tiny little rock, floating through space at, like, thousands of miles an hour. We should all just get along.",Finn Balor,"Living, Rock, Miles"

NASA will send up a big sun shade that will be in orbit between the earth and sun and deflect 2 or 3 percent of the sunshine back into space. It would be cheaper than the international space station.,James Lovelock,"Sunshine, Sun, Will"
"Tom Snyder was born to broadcast. He loved television and it loved him back. In that, he was a member of a vanishing breed, especially as narrowcasting displaces broadcasting, 'online' replaces 'on the air,' and any Tom, Dick or Mary can be monarch of a desktop domain, uplinking themselves to satellites in space.",Tom Shales,"Born, Air, Television"
"As a scientist in charge of space sensors and entire space missions before I was at NASA, I myself was involved in projects that overran. But that's no excuse for remaining silent about this growing problem or failing to champion reform.",Alan Stern,"Myself, Champion, NASA"
"There is one person who sends me three cards every year. One on New Year's, one for my birthday and the third that marks the anniversary of my flight into space.",Rakesh Sharma,"Birthday, Anniversary, Me"

"I can sing the saddest song with a bunch of people, and the feeling of sharing that energy activates in a way that either heals it or makes me feel like I've risen a thousand miles above it into space, and I'm staring down on it as a little dot.",Ryan Adams,"Energy, Me, Song"
"As filmmakers, we want the audience to have the most complete experience they can. For example, I interviewed Stanley Kubrick years ago around the time of '2001: A Space Odyssey.' I was going to see the film that night in London, and he insisted I sit in one of four seats in the theater for the best view or not watch the film.",Michael Mann,"Best, Experience, Time"
"A lot of the progress in machine learning - and this is an unpopular opinion in academia - is driven by an increase in both computing power and data. An analogy is to building a space rocket: You need a huge rocket engine, and you need a lot of fuel.",Andrew Ng,"Power, Learning, Progress"

Space and time are now dynamic quantities... space and time not only affect but are also affected by everything that happens in the universe.",Stephen Hawking,"Time, Universe, Place"
"The privilege I've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works... but what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition - to talk about beauty, to talk about power, to talk about ourselves, and to talk and speak to each other.",Thelma Golden,"Beauty, Power, Myself"
"During the dot-com days, one could take just about any company public and reap fortunes.

"I think that the ideal space must contain elements of magic, serenity, sorcery and mystery.",Luis Barragan,"Mystery, Serenity, Magic"
"Now that our kids are getting older, they need their space. We dug out the basement so they will have a place to go crazy in the wintertime. My son is already talking about how he's going to make a skateboard ramp. It's just a mosh pit down there, so they can do whatever they want. We're not even going to finish it.",Candice Olson,"Getting Older, Crazy, Will"
"That sacred space of conscience where you can exercise your rights in terms of religious freedom and deeply-held, reasonable beliefs is the core of human dignity.

"Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable. Relative space is some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces, which our senses determine by its position to bodies, and which is vulgarly taken for immovable space.",Isaac Newton,"Nature, Always, Own"
"When you face obstacles or go through different phases, I always relied on my music. I depend on my music, my teammates. So at the end of the day, having incredible music, for me, would keep me in the space I want to be as an artist.",Rick Ross,"Music, Always, Day"
"Humans having any kind of sporting chance against hostile alien invaders armed with superior technology - Good luck. If they're advanced enough to cross the enormous distances of interstellar space, they're advanced enough to wipe us out without breaking whatever in their physiology passes for a sweat.",Nick Sagan,"Good, Technology, Chance"
"I've discovered that half the people would love to go into space and there's no need to explain it to them. The other half can't understand and I couldn't explain it to them. If someone doesn't know why, I can't explain it.",Sally Ride,"Love, Know, People"
"We're going to be focusing our science on things that will take us farther and longer into space. For many of those experiments, the crew members are human guinea pigs, which is fine; that's part of my job. I don't mind being a human guinea pig.",John L. Phillips,"Science, Mind, Will"
"The space shuttle was often used as an example of why you shouldn't even attempt to make something reusable. But one failed experiment does not invalidate the greater goal. If that was the case, we'd never have had the light bulb.",Elon Musk,"Light, Never, Why"
An optimist is a driver who thinks that empty space at the curb won't have a hydrant beside it.,Jules Renard,"Empty, Empty Space, Driver"
"Whatever your political leaning, vote. This participation is vital. I feel the same way about issues like the space program, education, the military. The more the public focuses on these things, thinks and forms opinions, I think the better we are as a democracy.",Ron Howard,"Education, Democracy, Political"
"Growing up in the '50s and being in the '60s, in that revolutionary time space, I thought freedom was what I was looking for. Slowly but surely, it became clear that the last thing I was interested in was freedom. Because if you're going to be free, you have to be free from something.",Anthony Braxton,"Freedom, Time, Free"
"Consider: The human genome consists of about 3.3 billion base pairs. Since there are only four types of pair, that amounts to 0.8 gigabytes of information, or about what you can fit on a CD. With a microwave radio transmitter, you could beam that amount of information into space in a few minutes, and have it travel to anyone at light speed.",Seth Shostak,"Travel, Light, Information"
"Then finally I said, 'Okay, well, I want to know all the details. I want creative input. I want to be consulted. I want to know what they're doing and who's involved. And I want to see the space.' So they took me to see it, and then I realized it was major! All these red flags on the Rue de Rivoli with my name on them right by the Louvre!",Kate Moss,"Me, Doing, Name"
The Hubble Space Telescope is more than remarkable. It has answered just so many of those fundamental questions that people have been asking about the cosmos since people were able to ask questions.,John M. Grunsfeld,"People, Cosmos, Questions"
Space has always been confusing to politics.,P. J. O'Rourke,"Politics, Always, Confusing"
"Most architects think in drawings, or did think in drawings; today, they think on the computer monitor. I always tried to think three dimensionally. The interior eye of the brain should be not flat but three dimensional so that everything is an object in space. We are not living in a two-dimensional world.",Frei Otto,"Today, Always, Brain"
New Jersey makes important contributions to the space program. We want to make sure it just doesn't happen in Houston.,Rodney Frelinghuysen,"New, Important, Make"
"I love working at NASA, but the part that has been the most satisfying on a day-to-day basis, hour-to-hour, minute-to-minute, has been working on board the space station. Even if I'm just cleaning the vents in the fans, it all is important.",Peggy Whitson,"Love, Important, Fans"
"Although we are busy with our own work, we still try and spend time together. At the same time, we give each other space. I think that is the key to a successful marriage.",Gauri Khan,"Work, Time, Marriage"
"A puppet, for example, is just a piece of wood, a couple of rivets, but put them together, and if you know how to do it, and the audience's imagination joins in with this, then a miracle will come out of that machine. That is what we and the audience do in the theatre - we create miracles in that space.",Robert Lepage,"Imagination, Together, Will"
"I just downloaded '1984' for my iPod, but I've read that before. It just hearkens back to the 'romance' of my high-school days. I really liked the space I was in when I was reading it.",Lupe Fiasco,"Reading, Back, Days"

I try to space out my films.,Bobby Deol,"Try, Out, Films"
"When I first started going out to lesbian clubs, I felt a very binary recreation of hetero culture. There are butches and femmes, and I felt like I was neither of those things. I'm in a turtleneck and jeans and just learning to be comfortable in that space. I realized I don't have to be a certain way.",Dee Rees,"Learning, Culture, Binary"
"For the last several years and culminating in six months in orbit next year, I've been training for my third space flight. This one is almost in a category completely different than the previous two, specifically to live in on the space station for six months, to command a space ship and to fly a new rocket ship.",Chris Hadfield,"Work, Fly, Training"
I do strive to find projects that are trying to carve out some new space. I enjoy projects that leap away from the crowd a little bit.,Emily Blunt,"New, Find, Trying"
There's always space for me to grow and I think that experimenting and making mistakes is gonna get me to this position where I'm trying to be is always changing.,Benee,"Always, Grow, Me"
My obsession with outer space is my way of being different. I make astronaut music. It takes an astronaut so long to get to space - that's how long it takes to catch up on my music.,Future,"Music, Long, Way"
"I don't consider myself a competition to anyone. There is ample space for everyone here. When there are directors who create characters for me, why should I feel bothered or insecure? When it comes to updating myself, I work very hard to relate to the emotions of characters I play.",Kajal Aggarwal,"Work, Myself, Competition"
We'd never have got a chance to go outside and look at the earth if it hadn't been for space exploration and NASA.,James Lovelock,"Chance, Look, Earth"

"I love New York, but I can't deal with the cold and the small space.",Katya Zamolodchikova,"Love, New, Cold"
"I've always held the view that great states need strategic space. I mean, George Washington took his space from George III. Britain took it from just about everybody.

I like bags that are easy to wear and are pretty to look at. But I don't like them when they have no space and you can't put anything in them.,Alice Dellal,"Look, Easy, Anything"
"For clothes, I like Anna on Regent's Park Road. Anna Park, who owns it, has an amazing eye for fresh, exciting clothes. I also love Arrogant Cat on Kensington Church Street. Space NK on Duke of York Square for exciting potions. I think I stretch the term 'tester' way beyond its boundaries.",Sophie Winkleman,"Love, Amazing, Street"
"I never, ever romanticise life in the pit. It was a hard, dirty, noisy, tiring, dangerous job in a confined space, a very dark world with no toilets or running water to drink or wash with.",Dennis Skinner,"Life, Water, World"
"Sometime in the future, science will be able to create realities that we can't even begin to imagine. As we evolve, we'll be able to construct other information systems that correspond to other realities, universes based on logic completely different from ours and not based on space and time.",Robert Lanza,"Science, Future, Time"
"They're the last human beings susceptible to human shame. Politicians are the only people left for whom, occasionally, shame hurts them. Everyone else, we've sort of done away with it as a concept, and we're hurtling through space like animals, basically.",Jon Lovett,"Done, People, Politicians"
"People are fascinated by space flight. It makes them interested in science, gets them asking questions and motivates them.",Helen Sharman,"Science, People, Questions"

Why not a space flower? Why do we always expect metal ships?,W. D. Richter,"Always, Flower, Why"

Google is intending to compete with Uber in the ridesharing space.,David Drummond,"Google, Uber, Compete"
"I'd say, for me, it's cooking that gives me a space beyond music. I love food. And somehow, music and food go together so well. Cooking is very therapeutic. That preparation, the fragrance of spices, the wafting aromas - it just sweeps aside my depression, tiredness and name what you may.",Shreya Ghoshal,"Love, Food, Music"

"Kids today aren't listening to music audio-only. They're picking up a CD and looking at the lyric sheet and wondering why the pictures aren't moving around. Who wants to do that? It's like Bam Bam Flintstone hanging with the dinosaurs vs. Elroy Jetson who's flying around space. If I'm a kid, I wanna be kicking it with Elroy.",will.i.am,"Music, Today, Listening"
"Science fiction writers didn't predict the fade-out of NASA's manned space operations, and they weren't prepared with alternative routes to space when that decline became undeniable.",Gregory Benford,"Science, Predict, Science Fiction"
"There's a Danish architecture firm called BIG. I love architecture, and I always check out their work; they're very good at reimagining the way we live. They put the human experience as the focus, with access to air and outdoor space.",Nikolaj Coster-Waldau,"Love, Work, Good"

"Roman civilization had achieved, within the bounds of its technology, relatively as great a mastery of time and space as we have achieved today.",Arthur Erickson,"Technology, Time, Great"
"Laughter is binary: It either happens or it doesn't. As each joke arrives in the course of a film, the cavernous space of the theater is either filled with joy and laughter or with the quiet of cringing embarrassment. Every time you step to the plate to make a joke, you're going to experience one or the other.",David Dobkin,"Experience, Time, Step"
The James Webb Space Telescope was specifically designed to see the first stars and galaxies that were formed in the universe. So we're gonna see the snapshot of when stars started.

"It's coming home to roost over the next 50 years or so. It's not just climate change; it's sheer space, places to grow food for this enormous horde.

"The total number of people that do a job that has the same description as mine in the entire world is fewer than 10. There's a lot of effort looking for life in space - that's a lot of what NASA does, but they're not necessarily looking for the kind of life that can hold up its side of a conversation.",Seth Shostak,"Life, Effort, World"
"So many times, when you're doing a job, you feel like you're a nuisance at times to people, intruding on their space when you ask them questions; maybe they don't want to deal with you at the time.

"Sites need to be able to interact in one single, universal space.",Tim Berners-Lee,"Technology, Need, Universal"
"I think size is the most unused quotient in the sculptor's repertoire because it requires lots of commitment and time. To me it's the best tool. With size you get space and atmosphere: atmosphere becomes volume. You stand in the shape, in the zone.",Michael Heizer,"Best, Time, Me"
"There was a lake beneath me, but the big, heavy parachute which had to be opened two miles above the ground couldn't be steered. My first thought was, 'Lord, they send just one woman into space, and she has to end up in the water.'",Valentina Tereshkova,"Water, Me, Woman"

"I came out of UCB and, before that, punk rock, and the whole deal was you do it yourself. Get up and rent the space, get up and press your own records, get up and silkscreen your own tees, get it done yourself. That sort of self-reliance will only serve me. Any time I lose sight of that, my career suffers.",John Ross Bowie,"Time, Done, Your"
Something people don't recognize is that being on the space station is probably a lot like being in some kind of confinement - like isolation.,Scott Kelly,"People, Isolation, Something"
"Trending topics helped make Twitter a more relevant metric of what the world was talking about at any given moment.

"You can't get around certain stuff, whether it's in Darfur or on your block at home. What makes us political is your home turf, your family, your life space. You walk down the street, and automatically a human being is territorial, and political happens in that.",Sixto Rodriguez,"Life, Family, Home"
"Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time. To us, when we look at a redwood tree, it seems to be motionless and still, and yet redwoods are constantly in motion, moving upward into space, articulating themselves and filling redwood space over redwood time, over thousands of years.",Richard Preston,"Time, Tree, Look"
"Pollution is everywhere, in that ancient Greek sense of miasma: guilt experienced as abject body fluid, moral pollution defining what kinds of beings count in social space.",Timothy Morton,"Body, Pollution, Guilt"
"The Fifties and Sixties were years of unreal optimism about weather forecasting. Newspapers and magazines were filled with hope for weather science, not just for prediction but for modification and control. Two technologies were maturing together: the digital computer and the space satellite.",James Gleick,"Science, Hope, Weather"
"Yosemite Valley, to me, is always a sunrise, a glitter of green and golden wonder in a vast edifice of stone and space.",Ansel Adams,"Nature, Always, Green"

"I suppose there's a melancholy tone at the back of the American mind, a sense of something lost. And it's the lost world of Thomas Jefferson. It is the lost sense of innocence that we could live with a very minimal state, with a vast sense of space in which to work out freedom.",George Will,"Work, Freedom, Mind"
"Two kids in their dorm room can't start anything important in space today.

"I am always in my space and it's a happy space. It gets stressful at times, but that's a part and parcel of our job.",Amit Trivedi,"Always, I Am, Job"
"Throughout the movies' golden age, the Western enriched Hollywood financially and artistically.

"For so much of my life, I lived feeling as if, if I spoke, if I said something, I would lose everything. I would be pushed out. No one will want me. No one will love me.

This is who I am, and I don't care if you like me or you don't like me.'",Janet Mock,"Life, Love, Truth"

"In football, time and space are the same thing.",Graham Taylor,"Time, Sports, Football"

"We have responsibilities for others, not just across space but across time. We have responsibilities to people who came before us.

"In 1987, Merrill Lynch asked me to open a Swiss capital markets operation. I was 27. In hindsight, I was lucky enough to start a business from scratch.

"Now if you're using Twitter or other social networks, and you didn't realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it, you're like most of us. Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with.",Ethan Zuckerman,"People, Happens, Realize"
"If you're going to lead a space frontier, it has to be government; it'll never be private enterprise. Because the space frontier is dangerous, and it's expensive, and it has unquantified risks.

"Football doesn't depend just on your brain. It's not like on a computer. It depends on your body, too, and sometimes you are tired. Sometimes the opponent closes the space very well and marks you very well. Football depends on many things, not just on you.",Fernandinho,"Football, Brain, Tired"
"The causes for my eating disorder ran along the usual lines: depression, an inability to express my rage, a desire to exert control, a desire to feel less, a desire to have my body express the things my voice could not.

"I like the sci-fi channel. Just science in general. I came across a segment on time travel and how time travel is possible.

"It's about the characters, it's about the film, it's about the process of making stunning visuals and a huge, epic movie.

I enjoyed L.A. because it was nice to be in the sunshine and live in a house with proper wardrobes. I loved the space.,Caitriona Balfe,"Sunshine, Live, Nice"
"I don't think love is a tricky issue at all. Love is best understood when we share: Share time, energy, food, resources, insights, information, whatever. It's usually thought of as something that exists between two people, but that's just because it's easier to see and feel in the space between them. Each person is sharing a lot with the other.",Jason Mraz,"Love, Best, Time"
"About the 50th hour, I was going to start thinking about the edge of the universe. Is there an edge? Is this an envelope we're living inside of, or no, does it go onto infinity in both time and space? And there's nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this.",Diana Nyad,"Time, Swimming, Universe"

"I start from one point and go as far as possible. But, unfortunately, I never lose my way. I 'localize,' which is to say that I think always in a given space.

"When I was 13, I thought I was pretty hot stuff because I knew BASIC programming, self-taught on the family's Commodore 64.

"There's almost 70 billion in square feet under construction in high rises in commercial, residential and light manufacturing. And we estimate about 30 billion square feet, and that's with a 'B,' is commercial, that we would just consider office space.

"No, I think most astronauts recognize that the space shuttle program is very high-risk, and are prepared for accidents.",Sally Ride,"Accidents, Think, Most"
'Fright Night' I can just about deal with. Because the original is such a 1980s extravaganza. Which is a good thing. Obviously.

"The exploration of space: Be it by humans or robots, based on the best choice for the mission and the most efficient means to return the data and science sought.

"It's very sad that there's going to be a hiatus in manned space flight from the U.S. The Shuttle was a fantastic, hugely complex vehicle.

As the Shuttle era ends, another window of opportunity opens.",David Mackay,"Sad, Opportunity, Window"

"When I wrote the opera, I made a deal with myself that for at least an hour a day I would work on it, even if it meant just sitting on my piano bench, staring into space and thinking about it. It's about keeping it regular, like your bowel movements - let's get real: it's your bodily artistic movements! It comes from the same place.",Rufus Wainwright,"Work, Myself, Your"
"It's hard because I think I fall into this in-between space where there's something that's innately feminine about me, and there's also something that's kind of androgynous. I carry myself somewhere in between, and I think my music lends itself to that as well.",Halsey,"Music, Myself, Me"

Now I try to use the language of architecture to redescribe the body as a place.",Antony Gormley,"Time, Great, Architecture"
"Three decades ago, in a top story of the century, Americans placed six flags on the Moon. Today we no longer try for new and bold space achievements; instead, we celebrate the anniversaries of the past.",Gene Kranz,"Today, Celebrate, Moon"
Sorry; I have no space left for advice. Just do it.,Donald E. Westlake,"Advice, Sorry, Just Do It"
"The reason we have the stars twinkle at night is because the light is being kind of blurred by the atmosphere around the Earth. That is why the Hubble Space Telescope is so good, because it is above the atmosphere. So it is kind of like looking at the sun from the bottom of a swimming pool, versus looking at the sun above the swimming pool.",Michael J. Massimino,"Good, Light, Swimming"

"We don't do laundry because that requires a lot of water, and water's at a premium up here. Plus, it'd be pretty complicated, I think, to make a space washer, although I guess you could do it. So we generally throw our clothes out. I think I've been wearing this pair of pants for about two months.",Scott Kelly,"Water, Clothes, Laundry"
"Government paved the on-ramp to space. Now, the vehicles taking us up to the space highway are being built by citizens, leveraging off government-catalyzed technologies and needs.",Rick Tumlinson,"Government, Us, Now"

"I actually don't invest in anything that is social, mobile, deals or ad networks simply because those are areas where there are so many players and so many other smart people in the space, I feel like I don't have a competitive advantage.

"I was certainly no Maradona. I was a very fast player. When I saw a space, I used it. When I went past somebody, he didn't catch up with me again. I was a player who came with a run-up. What Maradona could see in a small space, I saw over long distances.",Lothar Matthaus,"Long, Past, Me"
"The management teams in these royalty and streaming companies have the highest-quality research and the most visibility into all of the producers.

"I have so much going on inside my head in terms of writing, there's such a large space in my life taken up by that.

I really don't.",Shonda Rhimes,"Life, Believe, My Life"

But I would choose freezing over being followed.",Mary-Kate Olsen,"Freedom, Respect, New"

If priority is allocated to a manned space programme, I'm confident we can swing it. But it's going to be tremendously expensive - the infrastructure and so on.",Rakesh Sharma,"Government, Country, Picture"
"I like to do things that are publicly embarrassing, to feel the embarrassment touch me and sink into me and then be gone. I like getting on elevators and singing too loudly in that small space.

"Thor is magical, yes, but it is the magic of reality. His hammer was crafted 'in the heart of a dying star,' but so were you! Most of the atoms that make you up are in fact the innards of a ball of gas in space that got so heavy that it exploded. Stars died so that you could live, as physicist Lawrence Krauss would say.",Kyle Hill,"Heart, Stars, Reality"
"An important part of the Internet is that it provides a space for people whose identities are socially unacceptable. If it enables someone who feels minoritised to be who they want to be, it's actually worth having other people be offensive.

"Even these stars, which seem so numerous, are as sand, as dust - or less than dust - in the enormity of the space in which there is nothing.",Carl Sagan,"Stars, Nothing, Sand"
"I think my darkest days were probably when I was catering. I would go to these parties and pass out hors d'oeuvres, and it's like you're invisible. I remember one catering captain told me that all you are is a tray that comes into their space for a moment and then you leave. It was one of the most depressing things I've ever been told.",Jack Falahee,"Moment, Remember, Me"

"It is a matter of common knowledge among mystics that the evolutionary career of mankind is indissolubly bound up with the divine hierarchies, who rule the planets and the signs of the Zodiac, and that the passage of the Sun and the planets through the twelve signs of the Zodiac, marks man's progress in time and in space.",Max Heindel,"Knowledge, Time, Progress"
I'm never interested in the painting being a mirror to culture. I think that's really boring. What I'm interested in is painting as an affective space. The place where the hierarchies of the world can be rearranged within the space of a painting. And they can be articulated in different ways.,Dana Schutz,"Culture, Mirror, World"
I'm interested in the space between the viewer and the surface of the painting - the forms and the way they work in their surroundings. I'm interested in how they react to a room.,Ellsworth Kelly,"Work, Painting, React"
