Rockets are cool. There's no getting around that.,Elon Musk,"Science, Getting, Rockets"

"I'd rate myself an 8. I do have my flaws, but I'm a cool dude. If I wasn't myself, I'd kick it with me. I'm a down-to-earth person and all around cool guy.",Lance Gross,"Myself, Flaws, Me"
I don't mind not being cool.,Chris Martin,"Mind, Being"
"Remember the first time you went to a show and saw your favorite band. You wore their shirt, and sang every word. You didn't know anything about scene politics, haircuts, or what was cool.

"I think adidas really understands that it's cool to be in business with the right people. It really feels like a bunch of creative minds rather than some rap guys stamping their names on a sneaker. We're arguing over shoes, ideas, and everything - it's like a tug of war.",Pusha T,"Business, War, Shoes"
"Racism is taught in the home. We agree on that? Well, it's very hard to teach racism to a teenager who's listening to rap music and who idolizes, say, Snoop Dogg.

"I don't really think much of any songs I put out like I know... I think they're good, that's why I'm putting them out.

It's cool to see a bunch of brown kids in the crowd. I wanna be a brown artist that they look up to. I didn't see that many artists with my same culture that I looked up to when I was growing up. The industry has always been whitewashed.,Cuco,"Always, Culture, Look"

Jail is definitely not cool. Education is.,Ja Rule,"Education, Jail, Definitely"
"I don't want to be just known for the way I dress. I want to be known for how I play, how I treat people, and how I am as a role model.

"I feel like I've kinda danced around telling the truest story I can for many years of my life.

"My biggest thing about being a role model is whatever I'm preaching, I'm practicing. If I'm telling people I'm boxing and then I'm eating a burger tonight, it's because I am. I'm not cheating and eating a salad and then being like, 'Yeah! Burgers are cool!'",Gigi Hadid,"I Am, Cheating, Eating"
"My aunt, Rosie Gaines, sung with Prince - 'Diamonds and Pearls.' And at the time, I didn't realize how big of a song that was. I just thought, 'Oh, that's my auntie singing with Prince. That's cool.'",Ro James,"Time, Song, Diamonds"

"I think it's really cool, but Jimmy Eat World and Gin Blossoms did it better than anyone. People don't realize just how awesome the Arizona history is, especially for alternative music. Growing up, that's all I ever wanted to be was those two bands.",Nate Ruess,"History, Music, World"
"Nowadays, women are looked at as equal to the men when it comes to competing, and I think that's a really cool message to send to little girls and show them that whatever they want to do, they can set their mind to it and make it happen.",Carmella,"Women, Men, Mind"
I never want to be a father figure to my quarterbacks. I've got my own kids. I want to be the cool uncle you'd like have a drink with.,Bruce Arians,"Father, Own, Never"

"The Russo brothers are the best people ever, and they cast me in 'Happy Endings.' I did text Joe Russo to say, 'I don't think my character dies, so if you need a local news cameraman to show up in 'Captain America 2'... I know it doesn't make sense, but just hear me out on this!'

"At the age of 11 I was about 6 ft. tall and my voice had completely broken. That caused problems. I was this gangly, spotty, very unattractive kid. I wasn't cool and I wasn't a nerd. I didn't even want to fit in with anyone.",Dan Stevens,"Age, Problems, Voice"
"David Lynch and I almost made a movie together in the late '80s. We had lots of dinners and lunches. He's a very cool, hip guy. This film, let's face it, is like an homage to him, I would imagine he'd find it funny.",Martin Short,"Funny, Together, Face"

"I like the way Quentin Tarantino creates a scene using a series of close-ups or showing very cool images of a person or people walking on some ordinary street in slow motion.

"I'm cool as a cucumber, baby.",Thomas Middleditch,"Baby, Cucumber"
"'Aladdin' was probably my favorite Disney animation when I was a kid. The animation was great and Robin Williams was unbelievable as the Genie.

That seemed really cool to me.",Zachary Levi,"Great, Amazing, Character"

"I think my main two songs are 'FWU' and 'Get Away.' 'FWU' made a cool point because it came out right after Chris Brown's 'Loyal' came out. I combated it with 'FWU,' a song that basically says, 'These women are loyal.'",Kehlani,"Women, Song, Right"
"If the world gets a lot hotter in a hurry and the primary aim is to cool it down, then the current plan of carbon mitigation will almost certainly not be effective.

"Weird Al was something that kids would listen to. It's funny, super funny, smart. It's just kind of jokey. I remember hearing 'Smells Like Nirvana' before hearing 'Smells Like Teen Spirit.'

"There's a gap between what I want to do, what I do on camera, and what gets edited. Right? So the goal is to try and close the gaps.

That's the biggest signifier of closing the gaps.",Matthew McConaughey,"Diary, Try, Closing"
"Think about how much fashion profits from black culture and how underrepresented we are in the industry.

"I arranged 'DT Suga,' which I previously used in lyrics, backwards. 'DT' is D Town and refers to my hometown.

"Pink is my favourite colour. I used to say my favourite colour was black to be cool, but it is pink - all shades of pink. If I have an accessory, it is probably pink.",Roxane Gay,"Black, Pink, Shades"

"I've had fans do some pretty awesome things... I once had a fan do a mock proposal for me in Mumbai, inside a McDonalds... and I've had fans give me some precious things.

"To have so many years in the rap industry and so many number one songs, and sold so many millions of records, introduced the world to people like Cool & Dre, DJ Khaled, Pitbull, Rick Ross, Trick Daddy, Remy Ma, Big Pun, Rico Love... I could go on and on. Having been able to influence the rap game for so long is very important to me.",Fat Joe,"Love, World, Long"

I just think it looks so cool when a woman has a dirty martini. She looks so powerful.,Banks,"Woman, Dirty, She"

I sang 'All Of Me' at the wedding. I sang 'Stay With You' from my first album. And then Stevie Wonder came up and sang 'Ribbon In the Sky.' It was impromptu... It was cool... He's always been a friend and a mentor to me.,John Legend,"Wedding, Always, Sky"
"In the Middle East in the summertime, to keep cool, a lot of people sleep on the rooftops.",Daron Malakian,"Sleep, Keep, People"

"When I entered high school I was an A-student, but not for long. I wanted the fancy clothes. I wanted to hang out with the guys.

"'Lose My Cool' is the second track on my EP dedicated to a stage in the grieving process. This track represents anger.

"It's just insane because, as a longtime WWE fan, I still have all of my action figures in storage.

That's one of them groups that bang it out.",Rakim,"Window, Crazy, Try"
"Hopefully everybody in the audience thinks, 'That's cool. I could do that.' I don't like the thought that they say, 'I saw the Beastie Boys last night, and they're mega-stars.'

"I've always believed in good music over bad music. I believe in two sorts of musics. And the lines that separate us, I don't believe in that.

But in L.A., guys in bands were also playing with other artists, touring with other artists, and collaborating with other artists.",LP,"Amazing, New, Trying"

So I think that's pretty cool.",Apolo Ohno,"Respect, Great, Amazing"

So yesterday, like two-way pagers. And AOL.",John Ridley,"Life, Your, Yesterday"
