"Easter is very important to me, it's a second chance.",Reba McEntire,"Chance, Me, Important"

But the chocolate ones, you must admit, can sustain only a fleeting interest. A sweet, sugary hit - and then it's gone.",Alice Roberts,"Sweet, Chicken, Eating"

Those have a short Lent who owe money to be paid at Easter.,Benjamin Franklin,"Money, Lent, Short"
"Fortunately, the DC Universe is full enough and replete enough with every kind of character that you could want, that it's not that hard to find the right character.

But I am infuriated by the growing notion, posited in some touchy-feely quarters, that all women are, or can be, beautiful.",Julie Burchill,"Women, Beautiful, Believe"
"When you ran out the tunnel at the old Easter Road for a derby game, you'd get a spittal right on the back of your head. They were spitting on you as you ran out, which actually helped get you going. It was some place.",Drew Busby,"Your, Game, Road"

"My passion was to be on Broadway and to be part of this community because I saw what it was like from the outside as the young kid in and around New York, and I would see things like the 'Easter Bonnet' or 'Broadway Bares,' things I would sneak into.",Max von Essen,"Community, Passion, New"

All three of those social graphs are powerful in their own.",Dennis Crowley,"Day, I Am, Hands"

"To the casual observer, the Dropbox demo video looked like a normal product demonstration, but we put in about a dozen Easter eggs that were tailored for the Digg audience. References to Tay Zonday and 'Chocolate Rain' and allusions to 'Office Space' and 'XKCD.' It was a tongue-in-cheek nod to that crowd, and it kicked off a chain reaction.",Drew Houston,"Space, Rain, Product"

"Prince was outside his dressing room, shaking one of those little Easter egg maracas. His hair was straightened to a soft wave; his eyelashes were unfairly lovely. He smelled like the most expensive shelf in the Sephora perfume aisle. This man wearing eyeliner, heels and ladies' perfume somehow managed to be more masculine than the burly bodyguard.",Mayte Garcia,"Man, Hair, Egg"
"I understand Christmas, and I understand Easter. But Halloween is one of those things where, if you don't grow with it? The French, they tried Halloween for a few years, and I think they're dropping it.",Jacques Torres,"Christmas, Grow, Understand"
"When I was in film school I had this great professor, Jerzy Antczak, a Polish filmmaker, and Joe Russo of the Russo Brothers were in my class.

That was the best year of my education in my life.",Justin Lin,"Life, Education, Best"
