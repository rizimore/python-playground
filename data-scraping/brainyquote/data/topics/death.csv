"I do believe that any sort of electromagnetic energy that can be measured beyond the moment of death is, by the definition of energy, eternal.

"As a pastor in a Protestant church, my whole ministry centers on the conviction that by grace we are saved through faith.

The change in religion was like washing away the past.",A. R. Rahman,"Change, Family, Religion"

"A weak soul does not have the endurance to resist the flesh for very long. It grows heavy, becomes flesh itself, and the contest ends.
