Global warming, in particular, is a creed, a faith, a dogma that has little to do with science.",Paul Johnson,"Faith, History, Religion"
"I actually started off majoring in computer science, but I knew right away I wasn't going to stay with it. It was because I had this one professor who was the loneliest, saddest man I've ever known.

"Once you have an innovation culture, even those who are not scientists or engineers - poets, actors, journalists - they, as communities, embrace the meaning of what it is to be scientifically literate. They embrace the concept of an innovation culture. They vote in ways that promote it. They don't fight science and they don't fight technology.",Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Technology, Culture, Fight"
"The split between religion and science is relatively new.

"My people are going to learn the principles of democracy, the dictates of truth and the teachings of science. Superstition must go.",Mustafa Kemal Ataturk,"Truth, Democracy, People"
"Remember, science fiction's always been the kind of first level alert to think about things to come. It's easier for an audience to take warnings from sci-fi without feeling that we're preaching to them. Every science fiction movie I have ever seen, any one that's worth its weight in celluloid, warns us about things that ultimately come true.",Steven Spielberg,"Always, Remember, True"
"Science is, rightly, searching for drugs to arrest ageing or to slow the advance of dementia.

"Just as Darwin discovered the law of development of organic nature, so Marx discovered the law of development of human history: the simple fact, hitherto concealed by an overgrowth of ideology, that mankind must first of all eat, drink, have shelter and clothing, before it can pursue politics, science, art, religion, etc.",Friedrich Engels,"Nature, Politics, History"
"The work of science is to substitute facts for appearances, and demonstrations for impressions.",John Ruskin,"Work, Facts, Appearances"
"I was not an anthropology student prior to the war. I took it up as part of a personal readjustment following some bewildering experiences as an infantryman and later as a prisoner of war in Dresden, Germany. The science of the Study of Man has been extremely satisfactory from that personal standpoint.",Kurt Vonnegut,"War, Man, Anthropology"
"I didn't like school at all. I never liked the seven different classes system. I liked having just one, like in elementary school - less disruption. I liked history. I failed math and science and gave those teachers a hard time.",Juliette Lewis,"History, Time, School"

"Art is made to disturb, science reassures.",Georges Braque,"Art, Disturb, Made"
"How could you possibly call something science fiction at this point unless it has to do with something that hasn't been done? When I write about 'Drones over Brooklyn,' it's not like I'm making something up. Drones are policing American cities.",El-P,"Done, Drones, Science Fiction"
"When you apply computer science and machine learning to areas that haven't had any innovation in 50 years, you can make rapid advances that seem really incredible.",Bill Maris,"Learning, Innovation, Computer Science"
Language is conceived in sin and science is its redemption.,Willard Van Orman Quine,"Language, Sin, Redemption"

The conflict between religion and science is inherent and (very nearly) zero-sum. The success of science often comes at the expense of religious dogma; the maintenance of religious dogma always comes at the expense of science.,Sam Harris,"Success, Religion, Always"
"Science is the first expression of punk, because it doesn't advance without challenging authority. It doesn't make progress without tearing down what was there before and building upon the structure.",Greg Graffin,"Progress, First, Down"

"Raising children is a creative endeavor, an art rather than a science.",Bruno Bettelheim,"Art, Children, Endeavor"
"I don't believe in diets. They don't necessarily work. What they do is scrub your weight down, but as soon as you finish, you naturally go back up. I keep everything in my diet - gluten and sugar - I just cut it down a little bit and train more. It's not rocket science.",Paul Hollywood,"Work, Diet, Your"
"Religion and science are the two conjugated faces or phases of one and the same complete act of knowledge - the only one which can embrace the past and future of evolution and so contemplate, measure and fulfil them.",Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,"Future, Knowledge, Religion"
"The rise of Google, the rise of Facebook, the rise of Apple, I think are proof that there is a place for computer science as something that solves problems that people face every day.",Eric Schmidt,"Day, Face, Problems"

I would have become a pilot if it wasn't for my poor eyesight and the fact that I am hopeless in science.,Richard Quest,"I Am, Poor, Pilot"

"If you want to save the natural environment, you just use nuclear. You grow more food on less land, and people live in cities. It's not rocket science.",Michael Shellenberger,"Food, Grow, People"
"I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.",Steve Jobs,"Space, Great, Beautiful"
"The rise of a new kind of political science in the 1960s has been driving a wedge between political insiders and voters ever since. By turning voters into interest groups, it stopped establishment leaders from articulating a national narrative. It opened the way for Movement Conservatives to create today's political crisis.",Heather Cox Richardson,"Today, Political, Rise"
"Britain punches way above its weight in science, and I think we need to continue to do that, and anything that makes it easier to bring scientists in will be very welcome.",John O'Keefe,"Welcome, Will, Way"

"If science fiction is the mythology of modern technology, then its myth is tragic.",Ursula K. Le Guin,"Technology, Science Fiction, Myth"
"Well, when you look at a lot of science fiction novels they're asking questions about power. There are questions about what it means to have power and what are the long-term consequences of power.",Junot Diaz,"Power, Look, Science Fiction"
"We never had books at home, but my dad, seeing how keen I was to read, took me to Islington Library when I was about eight and we pulled out two - a Biggles and a science fiction novel. I never got the ace fighter pilot but fell in love with all things to do with the future and space. Isaac Asimov soon became my guiding star.",Gary Kemp,"Love, Future, Space"

"In the U.S. you have a system of lobbying and influence on our policy and law makers which is incredibly pronounced. The gas industry spent $250 million getting an exemption from our Safe Water Act. Every one of those dollars is toxic; a contaminant in our political system. It disrupts the normal flow of justice, science, fact and reporting.",Josh Fox,"Justice, Political, Water"
My history is pretty different from the history of most professors. I was a high school dropout. I dropped out and became a science fiction writer.,Daniel Goldstein,"History, Science Fiction, School"
"I grew up in Saudi Arabia and India and Cyprus, and I lived in a war-zone myself, and, I mean, I had a pretty bizarre, I guess, nomadic childhood, and so I was really drawn to international relations and political science.",Hannah Simone,"Myself, Political, Childhood"
"The science of operations, as derived from mathematics more especially, is a science of itself, and has its own abstract truth and value.",Ada Lovelace,"Truth, Mathematics, Value"
"The fundamental concept in social science is Power, in the same sense in which Energy is the fundamental concept in physics.",Bertrand Russell,"Power, Energy, Physics"
"There's a magical energy and power from the ocean. I was born in a room overlooking the sea, in the middle of a storm. Perhaps, then, it's not surprising that shores touch my soul. Science might disagree, but I think there's a difference in the air on a coast - the positive ions, perhaps.",Jo Beverley,"Positive, Power, Soul"
Only by ignorance is science threatened.,Frances Arnold,"Ignorance, Only, Threatened"

Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.,Neil Armstrong,"Predict, Much, Too Much"
"The mysteriousness and mystique of space is such, that science fiction attempts to tantalize you by telling you a story that could possibly be out there and that's the appeal of science fiction.",William Shatner,"Space, Science Fiction, Story"
"Science is not a heartless pursuit of objective information. It is a creative human activity, its geniuses acting more as artists than as information processors.",Stephen Jay Gould,"Information, Acting, Human"
"Science, we are repeatedly told, is the most reliable form of knowledge about the world because it is based on testable hypotheses. Religion, by contrast, is based on faith. The term 'doubting Thomas' well illustrates the difference.",Paul Davies,"Faith, Knowledge, Religion"
"Scientific prayer makes God a celestial lab rat, leading to bad science and worse religion.",Michael Shermer,"God, Religion, Prayer"
"Science is the quintessential international endeavour, and the sterling reputation of the Nobel awards is partly due to the widely-perceived lack of national and other biases in the selection of the laureates.",John O'Keefe,"Reputation, Awards, Lack"
Science and mindfulness complement each other in helping people to eat well and maintain their health and well-being.,Thich Nhat Hanh,"Health, Well-Being, People"
"I don't think the law exists to arrive at the truth. If it did, we wouldn't have exclusionary rules, we wouldn't have presumptions of innocence, we wouldn't have proof beyond reasonable doubt. There's an enormous difference between the role of truth in law and the role of truth in science. In law, truth is one among many goals.",Alan Dershowitz,"Truth, Goals, Law"
"Science, as opposed to technology, does violence to common sense.",Richard Dawkins,"Technology, Violence, Common Sense"

"There has no doubt to be fundamental research in science, but applied research is equally important for new improvements and changes in our techniques.",Lal Bahadur Shastri,"Research, New, Important"
"When a herd of cattle see a strange object, they are not satisfied till each one has sniffed it; and the horse is cured of his fright at the robe, or the meal-bag, or other object, as soon as he can be induced to smell it. There is a great deal of speculation in the eye of an animal, but very little science.",John Burroughs,"Great, Animal, Smell"
"Boxing is a great example of it, but in football, sometimes you're taking greater hits than boxers. When you have one man going full speed against another man, and those heads are colliding, it's just the fact of science you're going to have results.",Jim Brown,"Great, Football, Man"
"Skeptical scrutiny is the means, in both science and religion, by which deep thoughts can be winnowed from deep nonsense.",Carl Sagan,"Religion, Thoughts, Nonsense"
"Traditionally, scientists have treated the laws of physics as simply 'given,' elegant mathematical relationships that were somehow imprinted on the universe at its birth, and fixed thereafter. Inquiry into the origin and nature of the laws was not regarded as a proper part of science.",Paul Davies,"Nature, Universe, Physics"
"What we want is scientists who don't become part of the policy discussion: All they do is produce science. If someone becomes an advocate, then I won't pay as much attention to their science.",George P. Shultz,"Attention, Someone, Much"
"The happiest people I've found are in science. These people have three times the IQ - maybe I'm exaggerating. They have a higher IQ than I do. They love what they're doing, they have a good family life, they're satisfied.",Eli Broad,"Life, Love, Family"
"Vanity of science. Knowledge of physical science will not console me for ignorance of morality in time of affliction, but knowledge of morality will always console me for ignorance of physical science.",Blaise Pascal,"Knowledge, Time, Always"
"Science is nothing, but trained and organized common sense.",Thomas Huxley,"Nothing, Common Sense, Sense"

"Science, already oppressive with its shocking revelations, will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our human species - if separate species we be - for its reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world.",H. P. Lovecraft,"World, Will, Never"
"We're lucky in that channels like Science, Animal Planet and Discovery are essentially universal in terms of their appeal. If you wake up in Moscow and put on the Science channel, it doesn't feel like an American channel, it feels like their channel.",David Zaslav,"Feel, Discovery, Animal"
"Before I became a film major, I was very heavily into social science, I had done a lot of sociology, anthropology, and I was playing in what I call social psychology, which is sort of an offshoot of anthropology/sociology - looking at a culture as a living organism, why it does what it does.",George Lucas,"Done, Culture, Living"
"My dad was a composer and a musician, but he never finished high school. His formal education was rather minimal from the standards of today's college graduates and Ph.D.'s, but he had a deep interest in questions of science and questions of the universe.",Brian Greene,"Education, Dad, Today"

"Blitzscaling is what you do when you need to grow really, really quickly. It's the science and art of rapidly building out a company to serve a large and usually global market, with the goal of becoming the first mover at scale. This is high-impact entrepreneurship.",Reid Hoffman,"Art, Grow, First"
"I read everything. When I say everything, I read everything: children's literature, Y.A., science fiction, fantasy, romance - I read it all. Each genre fulfills a different need I have. Each book teaches me something.",Jesmyn Ward,"Me, Children, Science Fiction"
"Learn computer science. It's extraordinarily helpful. I like recommending learning economics as well so they think in terms of business, they have rational frameworks for looking at the world, but yeah, computer science is an amazing way to get into, even if you want to be CEO, having a tech background is helpful.",Fabrice Grinda,"Learning, Business, Amazing"
The conscious purpose of science is control of Nature; its unconscious effect is disruption and chaos.,William Irwin Thompson,"Nature, Chaos, Control"
"If we study learning as a data science, we can reverse engineer the human brain and tailor learning techniques to maximize the chances of student success. This is the biggest revolution that could happen in education, turning it into a data-driven science, and not such a medieval set of rumors professors tend to carry on.",Sebastian Thrun,"Education, Success, Learning"
It was unthinkable not long ago that a biologist or paleontologist would be at the same conference as an astrophysicist.

"Politics is the science of who gets what, when, and why.",Sidney Hillman,"Politics, Why, Who"
"As a science fiction fan, I had always assumed that when computers supplemented our intelligence, it would be because we outsourced some of our memory to them.

"As a teenager, I had been growing away from the beliefs of the church, but one of the main things that caused me to question Christian Science was that the year that I left home to go to college, a boy who I knew in my Sunday School, whose name was Michael Schram, who was 12 years old, died at home of a ruptured appendix.",Caroline Fraser,"Home, Me, Name"
"Science would like to tell us that people laugh because of the benign violation theory, but comedy doesn't have hard rules.",Pete Holmes,"Laugh, People, Rules"
I've only actively promoted what we always hope is good science.,Elizabeth Blackburn,"Hope, Good, Always"
"Art is elemental. Reason alone as it's expressed in the sciences can't be man's complete answer to reality, and it can't express everything that man can, wants to, and has to express. I think God built this into man. Art along with science is the highest gift God has given him.",Pope Benedict XVI,"Alone, God, Art"

After graduating, I attended Stanford for a degree in economics and computer science.",Clara Shih,"Mathematics, Economics, Me"
"There is no conflict between the ideal of religion and the ideal of science, but science is opposed to theological dogmas because science is founded on fact.

Man, like the universe, is a machine.",Nikola Tesla,"Religion, Great, Man"
"Science isn't about authority or white coats; it's about following a method. That method is built on core principles: precision and transparency; being clear about your methods; being honest about your results; and drawing a clear line between the results, on the one hand, and your judgment calls about how those results support a hypothesis.",Ben Goldacre,"Your, Support, White"
"I have been on the road and visited numerous places and met people from all over the globe. I can say that it looks nearly the same everywhere I have been: The climate crisis is ignored by people in charge, despite the science being crystal clear.",Greta Thunburg,"Road, People, Crisis"
It seems to me that socialists today can preserve their position in academic economics merely by the pretense that the differences are entirely moral questions about which science cannot decide.,Friedrich August von Hayek,"Today, Economics, Differences"
It was my dream to come to Oxford and study political science.,Stormzy,"Political, Dream, Political Science"

But I did not want my children's public school teachers teaching them religion. That was my job as a parent and the job of our church, Sunday school, and youth group.",Adam Hamilton,"History, Religion, Youth"
"Science fiction has always been a means for political comment. H.G. Wells' 'The War of the Worlds' wasn't about a Martian invasion - it was a critique of British colonialism, and... 'The Time Machine' is really an indictment of the British class system.",Robert J. Sawyer,"Time, War, Always"

Similarly, those Democrats who would use climate change as a basis to regulate out of existence the American experience will face the harsh reality that their ideas will fail.",Matt Gaetz,"Change, History, Experience"
"The poker player learns that sometimes both science and common sense are wrong; that the bumblebee can fly; that, perhaps, one should never trust an expert; that there are more things in Heaven and Earth than are dreamt of by those with an academic bent.",David Mamet,"Trust, Fly, Heaven"
"I don't read 'chick lit,' fantasy or science fiction but I'll give any book a chance if it's lying there and I've got half an hour to kill.",J. K. Rowling,"Chance, Science Fiction, Fantasy"

"Man is unique not because he does science, and his is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind.",Jacob Bronowski,"Art, Man, Mind"
"Science is an integral part of culture. It's not this foreign thing, done by an arcane priesthood. It's one of the glories of the human intellectual tradition.",Stephen Jay Gould,"Done, Culture, Human"
"My approach to 'Star Trek' was, 'I know science fiction, and I know screen writing.' That was very arrogant of me, but you really need to be a little bit arrogant to think that what you have to say is good enough to justify the expense of hundreds of thousands - now millions of dollars - to make an episode of the TV show.",David Gerrold,"Good, Me, Know"
"In the 1950s, the average person saw science as something that solved problems. With the advent of nuclear weapons and pollution, the idealistic aura around scientific research has been replaced by cynicism.",Sheldon Lee Glashow,"Research, Problems, Pollution"
The historical development of the work of anthropologists seems to single out clearly a domain of knowledge that heretofore has not been treated by any other science.,Franz Boas,"Work, Knowledge, Historical"

"Being an economist is the least ethical profession, closer to charlatanism than any science.",Nassim Nicholas Taleb,"Being, Closer, Profession"
Science is one of a handful of things that defines us as a very special species. It is amazing how far we have been able to get and how accurate our predictions are.

"You can make real food in 20, 30 minutes, but we've convinced ourselves that it is a rocket science. It's a shame. It's the media and the food industry: they've fed our panic around time.",Michael Pollan,"Time, Food, Media"
I felt that chess... is a science in the form of a game... I consider myself a scientist. I wanted to be treated like a scientist.,Bobby Fischer,"Myself, Game, Chess"
"And knife making is as much art as science, as far as I'm concerned: Forging metals from an old farm tool into a blade thin enough to effortlessly cut a tomato yet strong enough to mince ginger, all while looking beautiful, is comparable to Ginger Rogers dancing backwards in heels.",Brad Leone,"Art, Beautiful, Enough"

Even though I did acting and I was in plays and drama clubs in high school and college, I still didn't think I was going to take it on as a career.",Retta,"Doctor, School, Acting"
"Mathematical science shows what is. It is the language of unseen relations between things. But to use and apply that language, we must be able fully to appreciate, to feel, to seize the unseen, the unconscious.",Ada Lovelace,"Language, Feel, Appreciate"
"The whole of science, and one is tempted to think the whole of the life of any thinking man, is trying to come to terms with the relationship between yourself and the natural world. Why are you here, and how do you fit in, and what's it all about.",David Attenborough,"Life, Relationship, Man"
"Part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians, poets, and artists, and zoologists, and historians. They also happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.

I don't recall any interest in science in particular. It came later in college.,Ellen Ochoa,"Interest, College, Recall"
"Science is a tool, and we invent tools to do things we want. It's a question of how those tools are used by people.",Margaret Atwood,"People, Tools, Things"
I was on the football team because I wanted to experience the different iconic social classes of high school. So football for me was an attempt to socially integrate in an interesting way.

"The American doctor, in my opinion, possesses a combination of conservatism and that other quality which has put the United States in the forefront in almost every department of science - that is, an eagerness to know what it is really all about in order that he may not be the one left behind if there is something to it.",Elizabeth Kenny,"Doctor, Quality, Know"
"Both of these branches of evolutionary science, are, in my opinion, in the closest causal connection; this arises from the reciprocal action of the laws of heredity and adaptation.",Ernst Haeckel,"Connection, Action, Opinion"

"I like solving problems, and science provides a logical way of solving real-life problems.",David J. Anderson,"Problems, Way, Like"
"More than fantasy or even science fiction, Ray Bradbury wrote horror, and like so many great horror writers he was himself utterly without fear, of anything.

"That the way to achieve higher standards of living for all is through science and technology, taking advantage of better tools, methods and organization.",Charles E. Wilson,"Technology, Science And Technology, Way"
"I think that's what distinguishes Schmidt, really. In the movies now, so much of what is appealing to an audience is the dramatic or has to do with science fiction, and Schmidt is simply human. There's no melodrama; there's no device, It's just about a human being.",Jack Nicholson,"Movies, Science Fiction, Human"

"In science, if you don't do it, somebody else will. Whereas in art, if Beethoven didn't compose the 'Ninth Symphony,' no one else before or after is going to compose the 'Ninth Symphony' that he composed; no one else is going to paint 'Starry Night' by van Gogh.",Neil deGrasse Tyson,"Art, Night, Will"
It is reasonable to expect the doctor to recognize that science may not have all the answers to problems of health and healing.,Norman Cousins,"Health, Medical, Doctor"

"Science fiction is a unique literature. Science fiction is the first literature that says, 'Tomorrow is going to be different than yesterday, it's going to be a lot different.'",David Gerrold,"Tomorrow, Yesterday, Unique"
"Science has a culture that is inherently cautious and that is normally not a bad thing. You could even say conservative, because of the peer review process and because the scientific method prizes uncertainty and penalises anyone who goes out on any sort of a limb that is not held in place by abundant and well-documented evidence.",Al Gore,"Culture, Uncertainty, Process"
Reiterating the belief that HIV is the cause of AIDS is an easy thing to do. Understanding the science and politics of the situation is much more complicated and requires study with a critical and open mind.,Nate Mendel,"Politics, Mind, Understanding"
"The science doesn't prove Common Core's effective. So I guess what I mean is science is an essential part of any decision-making process, and so is public involvement.

Newspapers and magazines were filled with hope for weather science, not just for prediction but for modification and control. Two technologies were maturing together: the digital computer and the space satellite.",James Gleick,"Hope, Space, Weather"
"I actually started off majoring in computer science, but I knew right away I wasn't going to stay with it. It was because I had this one professor who was the loneliest, saddest man I've ever known. He was a programmer, and I knew that I didn't want to do whatever he did.",J. Cole,"Man, Right, Computer Science"

Politics is a science. You can demonstrate that you are right and that others are wrong.,Jean-Paul Sartre,"Politics, Right, Others"
"Project 523 was both a good and a bad thing. They held so many meetings, and there were so many competing centres, it was a real mess. Nearly every province had their own research centre, and they all asked me to share my research, which I did. But that's no way to do science. They wasted a lot of money and a lot of time.",Tu Youyou,"Good, Time, Money"

"There were certain things that grabbed my interest, such as photosynthesis, such as us living off plants and plants living off us. You look at everything in that light - so if I'm looking at ice cubes, I might start thinking about absolute zero, or Fahrenheit and Celsius. There's so much that can make me think about science.",Gza,"Light, Thinking, Me"
"One problem with politics is that it is a zero sum game, i.e. politicians argue how to cut the pie smaller and smaller, by reshuffling pieces of the pie. I think this is destructive. Instead, we should be creating a bigger pie, i.e. funding the science that is the source of all our prosperity. Science is not a zero sum game.",Michio Kaku,"Politics, Game, Politicians"
"When it comes to art and science, people don't like a lot of either. Instead of being open to it, they're closed off about it.",Tim Burton,"Art, People, Open"

Science can promote an understanding between people at a really fundamental level.,Carol W. Greider,"Understanding, People, Level"
"With science and reason throughout history, what people believed turned out to be false. So I like to keep an open mind to all perspectives and learn and become more fully realised as a person. I just feel we're never going to know what the full picture is.",Conor Oberst,"History, Mind, Keep"
I love having my hands in the dirt. It is never a science and always an art. There are no rules. And if it comes down to me versus that weed I'm trying to pull out of the ground that doesn't want to come out? I know I'll win.,Matthew McConaughey,"Love, Art, Always"
"Those in science perform research, have it reviewed by their peers, publish the results, and believe the answer should be obvious.",Bill Foster,"Believe, Research, Answer"

There is actually a fair amount of money being put behind science today.,David Baltimore,"Money, Today, Behind"
"I like the sci-fi channel. Just science in general. I came across a segment on time travel and how time travel is possible.

"I feel it is now my duty to speak to young women, to encourage them to have careers and, particularly, careers in science.",Rosalyn Sussman Yalow,"Women, Duty, Feel"
"Fantasy is fantasy. It's fiction. It's not meant to be a textbook. I don't believe in letting research overwhelm the fiction. That's a danger of science fiction in particular, as opposed to fantasy. A lot of writers forget that what they're doing is supposed to be art.",N. K. Jemisin,"Art, Believe, Research"
"My fiction is reviewed by the mainstream press, by science fiction periodicals, romance magazines, small press publications and various other journals, including some usually devoted to archaeological and other science material.",Jean M. Auel,"Science Fiction, Small, Press"
"I don't believe in a golden mean; I don't believe you find policy wisdom between two polar points.

Mann,"Wisdom, Believe, Look"
"Therefore, the good of man must be the end of the science of politics.",Aristotle,"Politics, Good, Man"
"If you look through the shelves of science books, you'll find row after row of books written by men. This can be terribly off-putting for women.",Lisa Randall,"Women, Men, Look"
"It is not so for art in appreciation because art is concerned with human behavior. And science is concerned with the behavior of metal or energy. It depends on what the fashion is. Now today it's energy. It's the same soul behind it. The same soul, you see.",Josef Albers,"Art, Today, Soul"
"I'm not a great 'Star Trek' fan, but I love science fiction.",John de Lancie,"Love, Great, Science Fiction"

I think that what we should have is computer science in the future - and how it fits in to the curriculum is something we need to be talking to scientists, to experts in coding and to young people about.",Michael Gove,"Future, Time, Past"
"If spiritual science is to do the same for spirit that natural science has done for nature, it must investigate quite differently from the latter. It must find ways and means of penetrating into the sphere of the spiritual, a domain which cannot be perceived with outer physical senses nor apprehended with the intellect which is bound to the brain.",Rudolf Steiner,"Nature, Done, Brain"
We know from science that nothing in the universe exists as an isolated or independent entity.,Margaret J. Wheatley,"Universe, Nothing, Know"
"I don't believe there's anything in life you can't go back and fix. The ancient Vedas - the oldest Hindu philosophy - and modern science agree that time is an illusion.

"True science is never speculative; it employs hypotheses as suggesting points for inquiry, but it never adopts the hypotheses as though they were demonstrated propositions.",Cleveland Abbe,"True, Never, Inquiry"
"You know, every year 'Torchwood' has become something a little different than it was before. It's still sci-fi, but it doesn't just deal with spaceships and aliens all the time, because we've done that. Our science fiction is more psychological.",John Barrowman,"Time, Done, Know"
"I never could read science fiction. I was just uninterested in it. And you know, I don't like to read novels where the hero just goes beyond what I think could exist. And it doesn't interest me because I'm not learning anything about something I'll actually have to deal with.",James D. Watson,"Learning, Hero, Me"

It's the last barrier for Hollywood.",Kevin Kwan,"Family, Father, Mother And Father"

Logic is neither an art nor a science but a dodge.,Stendhal,"Art, Logic, Dodge"
"I'm not looking ahead joyfully to the rest of my life or the future of the human race. I've always written about man as an animal species among other animals, competing for limited resources.

"When religious believers invoke miracles and acts of creation ex nihilo, that is the end of the search for them, whereas for scientists, the identification of such mysteries is only the beginning. Science picks up where theology leaves off.",Michael Shermer,"Search, Beginning, Creation"
"I don't think that faith, whatever you're being faithful about, really can be scientifically explained. And I don't want to explain this whole life business through truth, science. There's so much mystery. There's so much awe.",Jane Goodall,"Life, Faith, Truth"
"The idea is to make the script out of a political analysis and then to convey that - sometimes in poetry, sometimes science, sometimes all it takes is a film. The film itself is less and less spectacular because I think very strongly now the more spectacular you are, the more you are absorbed by the things you are trying to destroy.",Jean-Luc Godard,"Poetry, Political, Sometimes"
