"Tell me how a person judges his or her self-esteem, and I will tell you how that person operates at work, in love, in sex, in parenting, in every important aspect of existence - and how high he or she is likely to rise.

I think parenting is very different now. We're totally governed by our children!,Andy Serkis,"Children, Think, Now"
"There was kind of a no-nonsense parenting style that my parents had that was true of the time. Everything now... there are books, and there are websites, and there are blogs, and you're reading, and there's research. We're such an interconnected world now, and half the stuff they did was pretty terrible, but we somehow turned out fine.",Adam F. Goldberg,"Time, World, Research"

"Children live in the only successful Marxist state ever created: the family. 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need' is the family's practice as well as its theory.

"Somebody once told me I treated my smart phone like Wilson, the volleyball Tom Hanks turns into a friend when he's stranded on a desert island in that movie 'Castaway.'

"I had three children while doing a show, as demanding as 'Good Morning America,' so this is - you know, it's almost like I'm less daunted about motherhood, and parenting at this point in time.

"Most moms and dads, they want to be good moms and dads. But it's an incredibly hard job when you are stressed out, when you are poor, when your life is in chaos. And giving them some of the tools to be better parents, to whittle away at that parenting gap, gives those kids a much better starting point in life.",Nicholas Kristof,"Life, Good, Your"
"Kids are a great analogy. You want your kids to grow up, and you don't want your kids to grow up. You want your kids to become independent of you, but it's also a parent's worst nightmare: That they won't need you. It's like the real tragedy of parenting.",Jonathan Safran Foer,"Great, Your, Grow"
"I'm a parent, especially when you've had the intense parenting the way I had. It's all in the bank. It's all in the great experience bank. Those are your secrets. That's the stuff that makes your work rich, that's what you dip into.",Hector Elizondo,"Work, Experience, Great"
"I think a generation ago, dads went to work, they came home, and they had their dinner, had a drink, and then went to bed.

"If there is any truth to my parenting the dreamwork movement, it comes from the power of the press.",Henry Reed,"Truth, Power, Movement"

America's parenting customs can shock foreigners.,Pamela Druckerman,"America, Shock, Foreigners"

"In response to our fast-food culture, a 'slow food' movement appeared. Out of hurried parenthood, a move toward slow parenting could be growing.

"I have a neuroscience background - that's what my doctorate is in - and I was trained to study hormones of attachment, so I definitely feel my parenting is informed by that.",Mayim Bialik,"Feel, Doctorate, Informed"
"We put more emphasis on who can drive a car than on who can be a parent.

Parenting is the most important job on the planet next to keeping Gary Busey off the nation's highways.,Dennis Miller,"Important, Job, Nation"

I adore my family. I don't love their politics. I think they're wonderful parents. They were dreadful at parenting.,Alexandra Fuller,"Love, Politics, Family"

The uncertainty of parenting can bring up feelings in us that range from frustration to terror.,Brene Brown,"Frustration, Uncertainty, Feelings"

"That's my parenting style - 'Go watch the TV.' I'm one of 11 children, and my mother's parenting style was, 'There's the TV. Go watch it. Mommy's got 10 other people to take care of.'",Stephen Colbert,"Care, Style, Children"
"Kids are soft these days, period, end of the story in every respect. People coddle them too much. I'm sick of that; it's irresponsible parenting.

"I don't think my father considered allowing a teenager to follow his dreams was necessarily good parenting, or even parenting. I think he thought I was a teenager with teenage impulses. I'm pretty sure he knew that if he just let me follow those impulses, it would wind up being very expensive and perhaps even life-endangering.",W. Bruce Cameron,"Dreams, Good, Wind"
"As soon as you become a parent, everyone gives you their parenting advice. It's like an onslaught of information about how other people do it.",Essie Davis,"Information, Advice, People"

I'm torn about late parenting. I believe people should spend their twenties living and having fun and not having any regrets later.

"I hope to find the roles that are age appropriate but not yearning to be younger, or parenting ad nauseam.",Debra Winger,"Hope, Age, Find"
"In truth, I am a single mother. But I don't feel alone at all in parenting my daughter. Krishna has a whole other side of her family who loves her, too. And so Krishna is parented by me, but also by her grandmother and aunts and cousins and uncles and friends.",Padma Lakshmi,"Alone, Family, Truth"

"We're living in a time when parenting is not at all mirroring the way I was parented. For me, I just followed my parents around on their errands; when they were busy on the phone, I was quiet.

As the nature of human life has become far more complicated, our ancient stress response hasn't been able to keep up.",Andrew J. Bernstein,"Life, Success, Nature"
"My grandmother was a kind of Scarsdale, New York, society woman, best known in her day as the author of the 1959 book 'Growing Your Own Way: An Informal Guide for Teen-Agers' - this despite being a person whose parenting style made Joan Crawford's wire hangers look like pool noodles.",Sloane Crosley,"Best, Society, Your"
"Ah, the power of two. There's nothing quite like it.

"I come from a dysfunctional family, so my views of parents and parenting used to be highly mixed.",Tamora Pierce,"Family, Parents, Come"

"Happiness is not always through success. Equally, the constant pursuit of success is sure unhappiness. But we have to find the balance. My own thoughts are that parenting is very personal. And we all feel enormous insecurity about parenting. What are they going to think of us 20 years down the line?",Amy Chua,"Happiness, Success, Always"
"Most people who have grown up introverted in this very extroverted culture of ours have had painful experiences of feeling like they are out of step with what's expected of them.

"Ironically, parenting is a shame and judgment minefield precisely because most of us are wading through uncertainty and self-doubt when it comes to raising our children.",Brene Brown,"Uncertainty, Children, Shame"
I think we've moved to thinking of parenting and pregnancy as something in which you should lose yourself.,Emily Oster,"Yourself, Lose, Thinking"
"My approach to parenting is that everything is open - everything. I'm not very good at covert, or subtle, and I've had to learn timing. I do blunder in a bit.",Dawn French,"Good, Timing, Everything"

The truth about parenting is that the reality of our lives needs to be enough.,Jessica Valenti,"Truth, Reality, Enough"

"I would love to have kids one day. In fact, I'm pretty good with them. I grew up with five half-siblings, the youngest of whom is 11 years younger than me, so I think I learned some pretty cool parenting skills quite early on in life.",Matthew Perry,"Life, Love, Good"
"Sociologists well understand that chaos at home causes violent behavior, educational failure and social alienation among children. Yet, many of us in America stay far, far away from this topic. That in itself is a national scandal. Bad parenting is gravely harming this nation.",Bill O'Reilly,"Failure, Home, Chaos"
"I'm not the first to admit that raising a child in Park Slope, Brooklyn, can bear an embarrassing resemblance to the TV show 'Portlandia.'

The science can tell you that the thousands of pseudo-scientific parenting books out there - not to mention the 'Baby Einstein' DVDs and the flash cards and the brain-boosting toys - won't do a thing to make your baby smarter. That's largely because babies are already as smart as they can be; smarter than we are in some ways.,Alison Gopnik,"Science, Your, Smart"

"We go into parenting, and we discover that we don't have the answers. We are at a loss.",Julia Cameron,"Loss, Go, Answers"

"We learn much of parenting from our own parents. My love for my father deepened profoundly when he was kind, patient, and understanding.",James E. Faust,"Love, Parents, Father"
"As a rule, I try to steer clear of opinions pertaining to your parenting. I assume you're doing the best you can, and God bless.",Emma McLaughlin,"Best, God, Your"

"A parentologist is a person who writes a book about parenting that is very clear about answers to, 'How am I supposed to raise my child?' Some of these well-intentioned people may be a bit too sure-footed on the sometimes slippery slope of parenting.",Clyde Edgerton,"People, Person, Sometimes"
My guess is that good and bad parenting is spread fairly evenly across different social groups. But can you imagine Tony Blair lecturing the middle class on how to bring up their children? He is far more comfortable as a latter-day exponent of the Poor Law mentality.,Martin Jacques,"Good, Law, Poor"
"In my experience (I am the lone father of an eight-year-old boy who lost his mother when he was one year old), parenting is the most difficult of all jobs: forget your chief executives, editors, prime ministers and the like - parenting is far more challenging.",Martin Jacques,"Experience, Your, I Am"
"Single parenting is sometimes just a case of sitting around by yourself in mild despair, not knowing what to do.",Simon Van Booy,"Yourself, Sometimes, Not Knowing"

Parenting a pre-teen is quite something.,Melissa Rivers,"Something, Quite"
Being a mother of two myself - and two small girls - I think that single parenting is hard.,Sarah Clarke,"Myself, Mother, Hard"

"I can only speak for my husband and myself, but we don't feel like we could do any of this parenting without our faith.",Jodi Benson,"Faith, Myself, Feel"

"No work-family balance will ever fully take hold if the social conditions that might make it possible - men who are willing to share parenting and housework, communities that value work in the home as highly as work on the job, and policymakers and elected officials who are prepared to demand family-friendly reforms - remain out of reach.",Arlie Russell Hochschild,"Work, Home, Men"
"Parenting girls makes you quite gender-conscious - it's almost impossible to fight the power of pink. It's not such a terrible thing to want to be a princess when you're five, but it would be nice if there were some other options.",Robert Webb,"Power, Impossible, Fight"
I've decided the secret of parenting is benevolent neglect.,Barry Humphries,"Secret, Neglect, Benevolent"
