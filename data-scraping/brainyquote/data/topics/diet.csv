I know it sounds cliche, but you have to find things you love to do.",Brett Hoebel,"Love, Commitment, Know"
"If you continually diet, you are putting your body in a quasi-famine situation. It slows your metabolism down and breaks the thermostat. Diets don't work. They don't help you understand why you're eating more than your body wanted in the first place.",Susie Orbach,"Work, Your, Body"
