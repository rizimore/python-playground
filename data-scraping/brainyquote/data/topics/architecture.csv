"A city building, you experience when you walk; a suburban building, you experience when you drive.",Helmut Jahn,"Experience, Walk, City"

Architecture is the thoughtful making of space.,Louis Kahn,"Space, Thoughtful, Making"
"To me, form doesn't always follow function. Form has a life of its own, and at times, it may be the motivating force in design.

"Not yesterday, not tomorrow, only today can be given form. Only this architecture creates.",Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,"Today, Tomorrow, Yesterday"

There will never be great architects or architecture without great patrons.,Edwin Lutyens,"Great, Will, Never"
"In a way, architecture is about communication. That's an aspect of the discipline that is somewhat lacking, and there's definitely room for more progression into that area.

I'm also very, very used to doing a lot of exhaustive research and finding interesting information from different sources.",Magnus Larsson,"Communication, Discipline, Research"
"In my early 20s I was so miserable doing construction, I wanted something that paid money. I liked nice stuff. I liked cars and architecture, and things that cost money.

I started to do stand-up, but I wasn't very good at it.",Adam Carolla,"Good, Money, Construction"
"Without this spirit, Modernist architecture cannot fully exist. Since there is often a mismatch between the logic and the spirit of Modernism, I use architecture to reconcile the two.",Tadao Ando,"Logic, Spirit, Cannot"
"With vocal and choral music, first and foremost, it's the text. Not only do I need to serve the text, but the text - when I'm doing it right - acts as the perfect 'blueprint', and all the architecture is there. The poet has done the heavy lifting, so my job is to find the soul of the poem and then somehow translate that into music.",Eric Whitacre,"Music, Done, Soul"

"Trying to describe something musical is like dancing to architecture, it's really difficult.",Robert Palmer,"Difficult, Trying, Something"
"When I started studying architecture, people would say, you know, 'Can you tell me why are all modern buildings so boring?'

Everything else that fulfils a function is to be excluded from the domain of art.,Adolf Loos,"Art, Nothing, Follow"
"Architecture produces a musical mood in our inner being, and we notice that even though the elements of architecture and music appear to be so alien in the outer world, through this musical mood engendered in us, our experience of architecture brings about a reconciliation, a balance between these two elements.",Rudolf Steiner,"Experience, Music, World"
"Architecture is a service business. An architect is given a program, budget, place, and schedule. Sometimes the end product rises to art - or at least people call it that.",Frank Gehry,"Business, Art, Service"

"Of course I know very little about architecture, and the older I get the less I know.",Richard Rogers,"Know, Older, Course"
"Architecture is involved with the world, but at the same time it has a certain autonomy. This autonomy cannot be explained in terms of traditional logic because the most interesting parts of the work are non-verbal. They operate within the terms of the work, like any art.",Thom Mayne,"Work, Time, Art"
"I fought violently for the autonomy of architecture. It's a very passive, weak profession where people deliver a service. You want a blue door, you get a blue door. You want it to look neo-Spanish, you get neo-Spanish. Architecture with any authenticity represents resistance. Resistance is a good thing.",Thom Mayne,"Good, Service, Blue"
"Jobs offshoring began with manufacturing, but the rise of the high-speed Internet made it possible to move offshore tradable professional skills, such as software engineering, information technology, various forms of engineering, architecture, accounting, and even the medical reading of MRIs and CT-Scans.",Paul Craig Roberts,"Technology, Medical, Internet"
Architecture is politics.,Mitch Kapor,Politics

I really am interested in home design or something like that... architecture.",Taylor Schilling,"Design, Home, Bridge"
"The Classic games were Classic because, like classical music or architecture, they strove to give life and weight to ideals of order and proportion, to provide a vision of timelessness.

"I see architecture not as Gropius did, as a moral venture, as truth, but as invention, in the same way that poetry or music or painting is invention.",Michael Graves,"Truth, Poetry, Music"
"Architecture is always the will of the age conceived as space - nothing else.

"Until the Eighties, Oslo was a rather boring town, but it's changed a lot, and is now much more cosmopolitan.

The new architecture of transparency and lightness comes from Japan and Europe.,Arthur Erickson,"New, Transparency, Europe"
"The body moves through space every day, and in architecture in cities that can be orchestrated. Not in a dictatorial fashion, but in a way of creating options, open-ended sort of personal itineraries within a building. And I see that as akin to cinematography or choreography, where episodic movement, episodic moments, occur in dance and film.",Antoine Predock,"Space, Day, Body"
The details are the very source of expression in architecture. But we are caught in a vice between art and the bottom line.,Arthur Erickson,"Design, Art, Details"

"It was the drawing that led me to architecture, the search for light and astonishing forms.",Oscar Niemeyer,"Light, Me, Search"

"Concrete you can mold, you can press it into - after all, you haven't any straight lines in your body. Why should we have straight lines in our architecture?

"I'd been to Stourhead and was inspired by the perfect parity between architecture and art; in fact, the architecture is the art. I wrote a piece called 'Not Sculpture Park,' because most of these things become car parks for bought-in sculpture. The artists should be working with the site, not just plonking pieces down.",Charles Jencks,"Art, Car, Perfect"

"The secret to the movie business, or any business, is to get a good education in a subject besides film - whether it's history, psychology, economics, or architecture - so you have something to make a movie about. All the skill in the world isn't going to help you unless you have something to say.",George Lucas,"Education, Good, History"

"To go back to architecture, what's organic about architecture as a field, unlike product design, is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm.

"I've always been interested in an architecture of resistance - architecture that has some power over the way we live.

Architecture is a ride - a physical ride and an intellectual ride.,Antoine Predock,"Ride, Intellectual, Physical"
"New York is just an energy. There's a beauty to the way it's laid out: the architecture, the way the planning is. It's huge, but you really do get to experience more than your own existence here.

"I used to think that the great thing about sculpture was that, like Stonehenge, it was something that stood against time in an adamantine way, and was an absolute mass in space. Now I try to use the language of architecture to redescribe the body as a place.",Antony Gormley,"Time, Space, Great"

"What makes architecture extraordinary is that you're looking at the building, but your peripheral vision is also seeing how it fits within a space. And it's seeing more than one part of the building at one time.",Sydney Pollack,"Time, Space, Vision"
"In northern architecture - the cathedrals of Europe and all the little churches - the details, the carving of stone, become necessary because the light is not there to help you very much.

I was interested in architecture. I was interested in every aspect of theatre.",Robert Lepage,"Experience, Me, Doing"

"For me, the excitement in architecture revolves around the idea and the phenomenon of the experience of that idea. Residences offer almost immediate gratification. You can shape space, light, and materials to a degree that you sometimes can't in larger projects.",Steven Holl,"Experience, Space, Light"
"I find the aristocratic parts of London so unattractive and angular; the architecture is so white and gated. But in New York, it's different - even uptown it's really grand, and there's no real segregation there. It's all mixed up.",Imogen Poots,"New, White, Find"
"If I want to make people moved or cry in a film, I figure out what the room looks like, what the people are wearing, what time of day it is, what the light is, how to photograph it, where to put the camera. It involves optics and costume design and set design and architecture.",Sydney Pollack,"Design, Time, Light"

"The last thing a young artist should do in poetry or any other field is think about what's in style, what's current, what are the trends. Think instead of what you like to read, what do you admire, what you like to listen to in music. What do you like to look at in architecture? Try to make a poem that has some of those qualities.",Robert Pinsky,"Poetry, Music, Look"
"I graduated from Wesleyan University with a B.A. in art. I was really headed toward an architecture degree, but when I did the requirements for the major, I realized I was more interested in how people live in buildings than in making buildings. I was more interested in the interactions that happened inside the structures.",Glenn Ligon,"Art, People, Buildings"

"I studied architecture in New York. So, really I was very moved, like everyone else, to try to contribute something that has that resonance and profundity of it means to all of us.",Daniel Libeskind,"Try, New, Everyone"
"I like things that are kind of eclectic, when one thing doesn't go with another. That's why I love Rome. The town itself is that way. It's where Fascist architecture meets classic Renaissance, where the ancient bangs up against the contemporary. It has a touch of everything. That's my style, and that's what my work is about.",Giambattista Valli,"Love, Work, Way"
My interest in architecture has always been sculptural. Most of my photography is of architecture.,Parker Stevenson,"Always, Interest, Photography"
I love architecture.,Chris Pine,"Love, I Love"

"In a place like the Greek Theater in L.A., to try and create a close connection with the audience seems almost antithetical to the architecture of the building.",Alex Ebert,"Try, Connection, Create"
"Jaipur is the capital of Rajasthan and, in my opinion, the best place to visit. It is an amazing hub of history. It's called the Pink City because all the architecture has a hint of pink in the stones used. It's an amazing stop for all kinds of food but also for history and shopping. It has a little bit of everything.",Maneet Chauhan,"Best, History, Food"
"I got into architecture via fine arts, and I was a sculptor myself, and I have always involved artists in my projects. When I say 'involved,' I mean I always bring artists in at the beginning projects before they're built and say, 'Will you do a room? Will you do a sculpture floating in mid-air? Will you make a chimney? Will you do something?'",Peter Marino,"Myself, Always, Beginning"
"I am an engineer, not just an architect, so I've always been motivated by technique or technology. As soon as technology moves just a little bit, it changes architecture.",Santiago Calatrava,"Technology, Always, I Am"

"Grenfell, the building set on fire with the help of its own face, is a scene of a complex injustice: one that is moral, economic, political, and aesthetic.

Architecture is not merely national but clearly has local ties in that it is rooted in the earth.,Alvar Aalto,"Earth, Rooted, Local"

"The truth be told, the World Trade Center was neither a very good work of architecture nor a very successful piece of urbanism. Its shortcomings were somewhat mitigated by the westward and southward expansion of the World Financial Center and Battery Park City during the 1980s.",Martin Filler,"Work, Truth, Good"
I'm very interested in architecture.,Nikki Sixx,"Interested, Very"

"You look at the steamboat, the railroad, the car, the airplane - not all of these were invented in the Anglo-American world, but they were popularized and extended by it.

"The thing I love about Rome is that is has so many layers. In it, you can follow anything that interests you: town planning, architecture, churches or culture. It's a city rich in antiquity and early Christian treasures, and just endlessly fascinating. There's nowhere else like it.",Claire Tomalin,"Love, Culture, City"
"Architecture is a discourse; everything is a discourse. Fashion discourse is actually a micro-discourse, because it's centered around the body. It is the most rapidly developing form of discourse.",Nate Lowman,"Body, Fashion, Everything"
"When I left the work world, I started designing my dream house. I dived into architecture and bought seven vacant lots. My plan was to build one house, move in, and build the next. If the next was better, I'd move in and sell the previous one - so on and so forth.",Tom Anderson,"Work, World, Better"
"The history of the Jews has been written overwhelmingly by scholars of texts - understandably given the formative nature of the Bible and the Talmud.

What makes 'The Marriage of Souls' such a wonderful book is Collins's intricate reconstruction of the late eighteenth-century world. Simplicity and philosophy are the hallmarks of eighteenth-century art and architecture.

"I have a strong sense that every project is an invention, which is not a word I hear being used in architecture courses.",Thomas Heatherwick,"Invention, Strong, Project"

The team architecture means setting up an organization that helps people produce that great work in teams.,Jay Chiat,"Work, Great, Organization"
"We need to rediscover the essence of the meaning of 'the use.' Architecture is, above all, here for a better living.

"I think architecture, to be really intense and fulfilling, doesn't have to be large.",Steven Holl,"Think, Large, Intense"

I like to play with architecture! It's my favorite game.,Jean Nouvel,"Game, Play, Like"

"All architecture has a public nature, I believe, so I would like to make a public space.",Tadao Ando,"Nature, Space, Believe"

"I've always known I wanted to be in design somehow. It was going to be architecture, but I would've had to quit acting for it. I realized with horology, I could learn at my own pace.",Aldis Hodge,"Design, Always, Own"
"The World's Fair was the precursor to theme parks like Disneyworld, and the really sort of cheap, superficial promotional architecture that you see everywhere in the U.S. I think there's a danger when you start creating a civilisation that isn't meant to last.",Sufjan Stevens,"World, Start, Theme"
"I wanted a real profession. And I'd always been interested in architecture and in design and in, really, what makes things work. And understanding what's kind of behind the walls and why things stand up and some things don't.",S. J. Rozan,"Work, Design, Always"
"A pool at the edge of the ocean is the simplest geometry, yet you feel connected to the sea. In a forest with the mountains in the background, you also feel the connection to nature, yet it's a very complex geometry. I think architecture is about controlling these feelings.",Ma Yansong,"Nature, Sea, Feelings"
"As a viewer, that's work I respond to - work that I know is singular in some way. If I'm being challenged by something on screen, if I don't quite know why it's happening, I want to know I can do the work of pulling it apart and that there'll be something satisfactory about it. If the architecture is sound, you can be lyrical in execution.",Shane Carruth,"Work, Way, Know"
"I started collecting aerial photographs of Native American and South Pacific architecture; only the African ones were fractal. And if you think about it, all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use. So Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry.",Ron Eglash,"Design, American, Use"

"A world of few choices, whether in jeans or mates, is a world in which individual differences become sources of alienation, unhappiness, even self-loathing. If no jeans fit, you'll feel uncomfortable or inferior. If no housing developments reflect your taste for unique architecture, you'll write screeds against philistine mass culture.",Virginia Postrel,"Culture, Your, World"
"Inspiration is around you. Like, when I travel any country, be it Paris or London, while walking on the streets, the architecture, the restaurants all inspire me. Inspiration for design could be anywhere.",Gauri Khan,"Design, Travel, Me"
"I acquired an admiration for Japanese culture, art, and architecture, and learned of the existence of the game of GO, which I still play.",Philip Warren Anderson,"Art, Culture, Game"
"Cost overruns are not uncommon in architecture, particularly for designs that depart from structural or technological norms, or demand a finer quality of execution than commercial schemes - conditions typical of buildings for cultural institutions.

"I haven't really got a green thumb, but I love gardens and their architecture.",Hubert de Givenchy,"Love, Green, Got"
"There's a snobbery at work in architecture. The subject is too often treated as a fine art, delicately wrapped in mumbo-jumbo. In reality, it's an all-embracing discipline taking in science, art, maths, engineering, climate, nature, politics, economics.",Norman Foster,"Science, Work, Nature"
What is being called the UN 'gender architecture' is more like a shack. Women need a bigger global house if equality is ever to become a reality.,Charlotte Bunch,"Women, Equality, Reality"

"I left science, then I went into art, but I approach things very analytically. I choose to pursue both art and architecture as completely separate fields rather than merging them.",Maya Lin,"Science, Art, Choose"
Perhaps because my town was so naturally gothic in its architecture and relative isolation - the roads often closed in winter - my stories tended toward the ghostly and the creepily suspenseful right from the get-go.,Andrew Pyper,"Winter, Roads, Isolation"
"I always point out to my Passover guests that the Hebrews were not living in isolation. They were at the crossroads of several great, elaborate cultures with their own mythology and religion and art and architecture and cultural belief. In fact, so many of the mythologies of the world describe the same events, just from different points of view.",Harold Ramis,"Art, Religion, Great"
"Architecture is undistinguished, sometimes derelict, but occasionally, as in 'Post and Beam,' there is something arresting in a setting... the building behind the Cathedral.",Edith Pearlman,"Sometimes, Building, Behind"

"I love antique architecture, so if I have any indulgences, I have owned and renovated and reconstructed a lot of old houses.",Daryl Hall,"Love, Old, Antique"

"Architecture, like dance, is also a language - one that everybody understands.",Santiago Calatrava,"Dance, Language, Like"

"Theatre is real-time - you get that real-time audience reaction, which is fantastic. And with art pieces, people don't ever have to explain themselves.

There are more complexities.",Elizabeth Diller,"Work, Art, Research"
