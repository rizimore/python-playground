"I've never dated anywhere else, so I only know L.A. dating, and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy.

I would just trade them for sneakers.",Kerby Jean-Raymond,"Money, Way, New"
"The women's movement gave me a set of tools to think about things like my body and how people react to me and the way that my dating life was going. It's a very practical movement - yes, it's about issues like how we can get more women MPs elected, but it's also about how feminism affects things like your relationship.",Naomi Alderman,"Life, Women, Relationship"
"Some black women hug me and walk away. A lot of black men talk about dating white women and how they've been there, too. People open up about their racial experiences. I feel like I'm a walking therapy session. It's quite intense. But it means a lot to people.",Daniel Kaluuya,"Women, Men, Walk"

"I run a dating site, but I will gladly tell someone, 'Do not date someone if it's not right.' And don't settle. This settling thing is insane.

"In the age of social media and dating apps, so many people are able to hide behind their Instagram page or their Raya page or Facebook. And it's like, 'Let's set something up!
