"Recently a study proved that working from a larger, less cluttered computer screen increases concentration. I could have told them that.

My hand moves far more quickly than my brain.",Stacy Schiff,"Good, Brain, I Am"

"You see these casting directors' lists of characters, and they're all boxed in. Twenties is the hot girlfriend, thirties you can still be hot but moving swiftly to hot mum.

"While I oppose the death penalty as a policy matter, in a legal culture in which we reserve the right to execute people for relatively routine street crimes, it seems quite absurd for the justice system to get squeamish about executing the operational masterminds of Sept. 11.",Benjamin Wittes,"Death, Culture, Justice"

"Legal documents have mistrust written all over them. It's unfortunate, but the human DNA is so tuned to kind of taking you for granted that we tend to protect ourselves legally. That's why I don't read them as, if I read them, I will go soft. To me, the human relationship is far more important than the professional bond I share with anyone.",Karan Johar,"Relationship, Bond, Me"

"There will be gay couples; it will exist. It is not very nice that people who are married - who divorce in three seconds - don't want protection for the others.

"Being under the microscope meant I was never given any slack. I still managed to screw up plenty in life, mind you, but in the things I really cared about - the legal work, or the stories I was telling as a writer, or the office I built in government - I wasn't left a lot of margin for error. It's kept me driven.",Ronan Farrow,"Life, Work, Government"
"I think my dad did legal work for someone who had a Packard Bell 8088, and they couldn't pay him, so they gave him a computer. I was initially not allowed to touch it, but that didn't last long. I started tinkering with it, and there were many times I screwed up the computer.",Jeremy Stoppelman,"Work, Dad, Long"
"I am a legal immigrant whose parents went from Russia to China to Chile to finally reach the United States and thereby give me a chance to have a better life.

"One thing I know from personal experience, judges hate it when parties talk publicly about their cases. There are a lot of things about our criminal legal system that need to be changed, and this is just one of them. Prosecutors know how to play the press. Most defendants don't.",Michael Arrington,"Experience, Hate, Know"
"With 'GoldenEye,' the franchise got locked into this legal fight. They couldn't make new Bond movies for about seven years. It was my first huge production.

"In an instant, the law was transformed: from the last passenger on the safe-haven bandwagon to a pioneer into uncharted territory.

Hylton,"History, Time, Age"

"While no Muslim worthy of his name would lose his respect for God, the Prophet Muhammad, and other symbols of Islam, he might well refrain from using legal prosecution or violent reaction to those who do not show the same respect. My basis for this claim is nothing other than the holiest source of Islam, the Quran.",Mustafa Akyol,"God, Respect, Lose"

"In America, to be ID'd - sorted, tagged, and permanently filed - is to lose a bit of one's soul. To die a little. This sounds like a subtle, poetic notion. It's not.

"The United States has an unfair advantage, as most of the popular cloud services, search engines, computer and mobile operating systems or web browsers are made by U.S. companies.

"If I was applying for a legal position, I would highlight my experience working for the San Francisco-L.A.
