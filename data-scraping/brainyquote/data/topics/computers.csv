"Social media has come a long way. With the good has come some bad, and you always have a lot of people hiding behind their computers and being very critical of what you do on and off the field, of what you tweet, of what you say, of everything you do.",Alex Morgan,"Good, Always, Social Media"
"Theaters are always going to be around, and doing fine. With computers and technology, we're becoming more and more secluded from each other.

"Computers add convenience to our everyday lives, but we are limited in what we can do with technology others have imagined. The ability for humans to teach machines entirely new things - coding - is nothing short of a superpower.",Tobias Lutke,"Technology, Nothing, New"
"Computers are scary. They're nightmares to fix, lose our stuff, and, on occasion, they crash, producing the blue screen of death. Steve Jobs knew this. He knew that computers were bulky and hernia-inducing and Darth Vader black. He understood the value of declarative design.",Wesley Morris,"Design, Death, Value"
"Young people, particularly in their teens and 20s, are not consuming sports the way my generation did. They are doing lots of things; they are multitasking.

The most used program in computers and education is PowerPoint. What are you learning about the nature of the medium by knowing how do to a great PowerPoint presentation? Nothing. It certainly doesn't teach you how to think critically about living in a culture of simulation.,Sherry Turkle,"Education, Nature, Learning"
"I'm pretty much a dinosaur in the studio. I like things hand-drawn, even today. The story artists use Cintiqs, but I'm the only person who hasn't completely converted to computers. I like the Cintiq, but there's something about the raw emotional power of using paper and pencil.",Walt Dohrn,"Power, Today, Person"
"Cable boxes are, almost without exception, awful. They're under-powered computers running very badly designed software. Their channel guides are slow, poorly laid out, and usually riddled with ads.",Alex Pareene,"Slow, Software, Almost"
Computers are hierarchical. We have a desktop and hierarchical files which have to mean everything.,Ted Nelson,"Everything, Mean, Which"
"As a science fiction fan, I had always assumed that when computers supplemented our intelligence, it would be because we outsourced some of our memory to them. We would ask questions, and our machines would give oracular - or supremely practical - replies.",Gary Wolf,"Science, Intelligence, Always"
"When you learn to read and write, it opens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things. When you learn to read, you can then read to learn. And it's the same thing with coding. If you learn to code, you can code to learn. Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious. You learn more about how computers work.",Mitchel Resnick,"Work, Things, Same Thing"

"I look like a geeky hacker, but I don't know anything about computers.",Justin Long,"Look, Hacker, Know"
"I wonder what would have happened if automation and computers had existed when 'Oklahoma!' was having its out-of-town try-out, and three days before closing in Boston, when it was still called 'Away We Go,' they added a new song called 'Oklahoma!' I don't think that could happen today. It's almost impossible to change musicals on the go now.",Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Change, Today, Impossible"
"The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.",Tim Berners-Lee,"Work, Better, Information"

"Why pay a fee for Internet content when a million free sites are just a click away? There's no incentive until people are too addicted to the Net to turn off their computers, yet are bored with what's available.",Nathan Myhrvold,"Internet, Free, People"
"We are the greatest computers in this world, but now we've created the smart phone which is smarter than us now, but we're still making dumb decisions. We have given our creations more power than we have, and that to me is dumb.",Bootsy Collins,"Power, Smart, World"
Maths is fundamentally a different process in education than it is in the real world. There is an insistence that we do maths by hand when most of it is done by computers. The idea that you have to do everything by hand before you can operate a computer is nonsense.,Conrad Wolfram,"Education, Done, World"
"I was playing in bands and doing gigs from the age of 14 on. I stopped at the age of 28. Technology replaced me. As soon as I saw what computers can do, I didn't think there would be a point for a live drummer.",Mitchell Joachim,"Technology, Age, Me"
You can't have thousands of cars without good computers on the electric grid.,Shai Agassi,"Good, Without, Grid"
"Bounty hunters these days - because everything is so sophisticated with computers and surveillance, it doesn't have to be a one-man-army-type guy who goes in and kicks a door down.",Mickey Rourke,"Door, Everything, Down"
"I've always been into computers. When I was getting out of high school and forming my identity musically, all of it was really coming into the fold, computers and drum machines. It felt like, you know, I'm in the right place at the right time. I liked the collision.",Trent Reznor,"Time, Always, Identity"

"Computers are wasteful of paper and time. Once, we'd get documents with a few errors. Now, people make hundreds of copies until each sheet is flawless and memos are duplicated endlessly. Managers get swamped with emails.",Felix Dennis,"Time, People, Make"
"My dad could be beyond brilliant but totally introverted. If we're talking about computers, he's on. Otherwise, he's a total recluse - he stays in the house and won't leave, and I'm like that. If I'm not working, I'm locked up in my room.",Alessandra Torresani,"Dad, Room, Beyond"

I like computers as a tool. I like them as an instrument. I think they're just pretty.,Dallas Roberts,"Think, Like, Instrument"
I don't understand computers. I've been unable to construct a working mental model of how they do what they do. I can break software by looking at it. I can blow anything up. Without trying. It's sort of like being a dowser. And this extreme elaborate clumsiness on my part is actually something people will pay me for. It's quite wonderful.,Brenda Laurel,"Me, Will, People"
"People are mostly focused on defending the computers on the Internet, and there's been surprisingly little attention to defending the Internet itself as a communications medium.",W. Daniel Hillis,"Internet, People, Attention"

"Doing a movie about computers between 1978 and 1982? You can't get much less sexy, less active than that.",Joshua Michael Stern,"Sexy, Doing, Much"

"When I write a song, I always start on acoustic guitar, because that's a good test of a song, when it's really open and bare. You can often mislead yourself if you start with computers and samples and programming because you can disguise a bad song.",Martin Gore,"Good, Always, Yourself"
"I think of myself as a Hollywood hillbilly, but I'm sick of all these questions people ask about Alabama. 'Do you have an outhouse?' 'Is there a lot of inbreeding in your family?'

"I don't take for granted all the blessings that I have, and as soon as I heard about Computers for Youth, I really wanted to be involved.

"My love of computers, besides being practical, is very direct and visceral. I love the way things look on the screen.",Penn Jillette,"Love, Look, Way"

"Everyone knows, or should know, that everything we type on our computers or say into our cell phones is being disseminated throughout the datasphere. And most of it is recorded and parsed by big data servers. Why do you think Gmail and Facebook are free? You think they're corporate gifts? We pay with our data.",Douglas Rushkoff,"Free, Know, Everyone"
Google did a great job hacking the Web to create search - and then monetizing search with advertising. And Apple did a great job humanizing hardware and software so that formerly daunting computers and applications could become consumer-friendly devices - even a lifestyle brand.,Douglas Rushkoff,"Great, Search, Hacking"
"Not only have computers changed the way we think, they've also discovered what makes humans think - or think we're thinking. At least enough to predict and even influence it.",Douglas Rushkoff,"Thinking, Influence, Way"

"The reason why Apple computers have worked so well over time is that, unlike Microsoft, they don't bend over backward to be compatible with every piece of hardware or software in the digital universe. To code or create for Apple, you follow Apple's rules. If you're even allowed to.",Douglas Rushkoff,"Time, Universe, Digital"
"Technology has moved away from sharing and toward ownership. This suits software and hardware companies just fine: They create new, bloated programs that require more disk space and processing power. We buy bigger, faster computers, which then require more complex operating systems, and so on.",Douglas Rushkoff,"Power, Technology, Space"
"If you write a blog post, you've got something to say; you're not just creating words and synonyms. We'd like the computers to actually pick up on that semantic meaning.",Ray Kurzweil,"Words, Meaning, Something"
"I'm working on artificial intelligence. Actually, natural language understanding, which is to get computers to understand the meaning of documents.",Ray Kurzweil,"Intelligence, Language, Understanding"

"Pixar is not about computers, it's about people.",John Lasseter,"People, About, Pixar"
"When I first started making ambient music, I was setting up systems using synthesizers that generated pulses more or less randomly. The end result is a kind of music that continuously changes. Of course, until computers came along, all I could actually present of that work was a piece of its output.",Brian Eno,"Work, Music, Result"
"Hard systems are everything we're using right now - computers, phones, planes, the clothes you're wearing, the room you're in. Everything there involves 100% use of technology and expertise to make it, and nothing we make - including space exploration vehicles and so on - is complex. Everything we make is complicated. Nothing is self-renewing.",Allan Savory,"Technology, Space, Nothing"
"Computers let people avoid people, going out to explore. It's so different to just open a website instead of looking at a Picasso in a museum in Paris.",Raf Simons,"Website, People, Looking"
"As a child, I did what any normal kid who grew up without any electricity would do - I spent countless hours working on a computer wired to my parents' car battery... and learned how to code. This natural passion for computers lead me into the Internet market during the late 1990s and early 2000s.",Ryan Holmes,"Car, Internet, Passion"
Why is it that I notice so many brilliant scientists using Macs for their personal computers; why does the Lawrence Livermore & Berkeley Labs buy millions of dollars worth of Macs?,Lene Hau,"Why, Brilliant, Worth"
"The computer is not, in our opinion, a good model of the mind, but it is as the trumpet is to the orchestra - you really need it. And so, we have very massive simulations in computers because the problem is, of course, very complex.",Gerald Edelman,"Good, Mind, Opinion"
"I truly believe that you have to bring more content to the table to survive in radio than saying, 'There was AC/DC, and here's Journey,' because computers can do that.",Eddie Trunk,"Journey, Believe, Survive"
"I started with CB radio, ham radio, and eventually went into computers. And I was just fascinated with it. And back then, when I was in school, computer hacking was encouraged. It was an encouraged activity. In fact, I remember one of the projects my teacher gave me was writing a log-in simulator.",Kevin Mitnick,"Teacher, Remember, Me"
"When I was a kid, I really liked playing chess, which is pretty geeky; I just enjoyed it - thinking, exercising my mind. And I found computers to be like an eight-hour day chess game.",Michael Birch,"Day, Mind, Game"
"I'm actually pretty good with computers. I use computers when I'm working on making and producing music, so I do know a thing or two!",Nick Jonas,"Good, Music, Know"

"I have nothing against investment banking, but it's like massaging money rather than creating money. If you're in physics, you create inventions, you create lasers, you create transistors, computers, GPS.",Michio Kaku,"Money, Nothing, Physics"
"Computers seem a little too adaptively flexible, like the strange natives, odd societies, and head cases we study in the social sciences. There's more opposable thumb in the digital world than I care for; it's awfully close to human.",P. J. O'Rourke,"World, Care, Digital"
"More than any other modern tool, computers are a total mystery to their users. Most people never open them up to fix them or to see how they work.",Clive Thompson,"Work, Mystery, People"

Computers double their performance every month.,Stephen Hawking,"Performance, Month, Double"
"We're seeing an enormous amount of global upward mobility that's quite rapid and quite sudden, and undiscovered individuals have a chance - using the Internet, using computers - to prove themselves very quickly. So I think the mobility story will be a quite complicated one.",Tyler Cowen,"Chance, Internet, Will"
"When humans team up with computers to play chess, the humans who do best are not necessarily the strongest players. They're the ones who are modest and who know when to listen to the computer. Often, what the human adds is knowledge of when the computer needs to look more deeply.",Tyler Cowen,"Best, Knowledge, Look"
"There's so much free material on the Internet you can learn from, and some people are pure self-starters: they pick up computers and teach themselves everything. Certainly there are millions of people like that. But at the same time, I think it's a pretty small percentage of the population.",Tyler Cowen,"Time, Internet, Free"
"In chess, computers show that what we call 'strategy' is reducible to tactics, ultimately. It only looks creative to us. They are still just glorified cash registers. This should make us feel uncomfortable, whether or not we think computers will ever be good composers of music or artistic painters.",Tyler Cowen,"Good, Music, Will"
I hate the thought of my children being glued to a screen. Children only play on computers all day because their parents let them.,Mariella Frostrup,"Hate, Day, Parents"
"Fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded. So, half as much grain is half as much useful, but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer, and we've been trying to make computers that work that way.",Neil Gershenfeld,"Work, Economics, Way"
"Our computers double in capability on time scales of only a few years. It's hardly outrageous to believe that we will successfully develop thinking machines within a handful of decades, or at most a century or two. If that happens, these artificial sentients will quickly leave us behind.",Seth Shostak,"Time, Believe, Thinking"
"I had been doing MP3 players and handheld computers since 1990-1991, and so they sought me out because of my experience. And about 18 generations of iPod and three generations of iPhone later, I decided to leave Apple.",Tony Fadell,"Experience, Me, Doing"
"Computers are great tools, but they need to be applied to the physical world.",Tony Fadell,"Great, World, Tools"
"I was nerdy and really into computers. I was a good student until my senior year, when I started traveling and had a lot of absences.",Tony Hawk,"Good, Until, Year"
"Some things, like the orbits of the planets, can be calculated far into the future. But that's atypical. In most contexts, there is a limit. Even the most fine-grained computation can only forecast British weather a few days ahead. There are limits to what can ever be learned about the future, however powerful computers become.",Martin Rees,"Future, Weather, Limits"
"When I helped to develop the open standards that computers use to communicate with one another across the Net, I hoped for but could not predict how it would blossom and how much human ingenuity it would unleash.",Vint Cerf,"Blossom, Predict, Human"

"Everybody jokes about that old story about the world only needing five computers, but when you think about it, that's where we're heading.",Matt Mullenweg,"World, Story, Old"
"I am not a great fan of computers. I do watch videos and analyse which batsman is playing how. Batsmen can play different shots on different days. A batsman may not play cover drives well, but if he connects with two such shots, he starts playing the drive well on that day.",Harbhajan Singh,"Great, Day, I Am"
"I started on computers with 'Billy Bathgate,' a little orange screen with black letters.

Doctorow,"Cool, Myself, Discipline"

"As smartphones have allowed us to have our computers, emails, social media feeds, and a full surveillance system in our pockets at all times, stories of the law enforcement's unease with that have been popping up in the press. And of course, the ones that become viral videos aren't exactly flattering for law enforcement.",Sarah Lacy,"Social Media, Law, Media"

I'm not really a knob-twiddler. I always work with an engineer; I'm not super hands-on when it comes to mixing boards and computers. I'm much more about what I'm hearing and what it needs to be like. I deal with songs and ideas and instruments.,Danger Mouse,"Work, Always, Ideas"
"If computers remain far worse than us at image recognition, a certain over-confident combination of man and machine can elsewhere take inaccuracy to a whole new level.",Tom Chatfield,"Man, New, Image"

Computers have cut-and-paste functions. So does right-wing historical memory.,Rick Perlstein,"Memory, Historical, Right-Wing"
"We think we're saving time with microwaves, cell phones, beepers, computers and voice mail, but often these things help us create the illusion of getting somewhere - and they foster a chain of constant activity.

One thing that humans still do better than computers is recognize images.,Peter Diamandis,"Better, One Thing, Still"

This is a huge gap between our experiences as children.",Jeff Lemire,"Technology, Relationship, World"
