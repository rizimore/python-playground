"I'm not a fan of musicals at all, but I do think 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is a very good. I always thought 'Walk the Line' was very good, too. I was in 'Nowhere Boy.' I played Paul McCartney. That was kind of musical - we did songs in that.",Thomas Brodie-Sangster,"Good, Always, Walk"

J. Liebling,"Life, Beauty, Black"

I'm Jewish and my wife isn't so right now we're literally decorating a Christmas tree with Jewish stars draped around it.,Max Greenfield,"Wife, Stars, Tree"

"It is always weird to be in the studio working on Christmas music in June and July, so we decorated the entire studio, we really did.

I had never been so excited by the sight of a book - and have possibly never been since!",Sophie Kinsella,"Morning, Find, Never"

"Every Christmas should begin with the sound of bells, and when I was a child mine always did. But they were sleigh bells, not church bells, for we lived in a part of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where there were no churches.",Paul Engle,"Always, Church, Sound"
"I love all the gift guides that the magazines put out, whether it's 'InStyle' doing Mother's Day gifts or color guides, or the 'O' magazine Christmas guide.",Dylan Lauren,"Love, Day, Gift"

"I have a love/hate relationship with Amy Grant, but I do go back to her Christmas albums once in a while. They're dated and sentimental and the production is nearly unlistenable, but there's something about her vocal performance that just feels really true. I would take her Christmas albums over Mariah Carey's or Destiny's Child's any day.",Sufjan Stevens,"Relationship, Day, Destiny"
"I think I'm a lot like other moms out there who feel like if we don't have the pecan pie we have every year, then it just won't be Christmas.",Faith Hill,"Feel, Pie, Think"

Christmas comes during a season when the Earth is in its darkest time. It's a holiday for the family and for everyone.,Melissa Etheridge,"Family, Time, Earth"
"At the heart of every really good Christmas movie is the threat, I suppose, to Christmas. Something is wrong with Christmas, in all of these movies.

I don't know if anybody's ever ready for another award season. It's kind of like Christmas.,James McAvoy,"Award, Know, Ready"

"Part of me wants to be married and have everybody around the table for Christmas. But when you're married, your life becomes integrated solely with that person.

"I hate feeling full, so Christmas is about the only time I really stuff myself.",Rupert Penry-Jones,"Time, Myself, Hate"
"I've always been shy, but I see that as a good thing because it kept me focused on music. When I was in seventh grade, I asked my parents for a mobile recording system for Christmas, and I got it. I didn't come out of my room for years after that. I'd get invited to the movies and I'd say, 'I'm gonna finish a couple of demos.'",Hunter Hayes,"Good, Music, Movies"
"We try to make the name longer and longer every year. First, it was 'Larry the Cable Guy's Christmas Spectacular.' Then it was 'It's a Very Larry Christmas.'

"I stopped going to Kingdom Hall, the church, when I was 11 years old, so I was very young.

"I don't go back home to Sardinia as much as I would like, just for Christmas and family events.",Caterina Murino,"Family, Home, Go"

"Fragrance is a very personal gift, and I think that's why it makes a great Christmas gift. There's a very distinct signature to it, so if you give it as a gift, I like to think that it's from a person that thinks very highly of you.",Ryan Reynolds,"Great, Fragrance, Gift"
"At Christmas, I am always struck by how the spirit of togetherness lies also at the heart of the Christmas story. A young mother and a dutiful father with their baby were joined by poor shepherds and visitors from afar. They came with their gifts to worship the Christ child.",Queen Elizabeth II,"Always, Heart, I Am"
"I do have a family, and I do have friends, and so-called friends, and acquaintances, and many other people I see only around Christmas time. Maybe they could vouch for me.

I read the Scriptures at the American Cathedral on Christmas and Easter; that's it. It's a task I love.,Olivia De Havilland,"Love, Easter, American"

I eat everything I want on Christmas day. I really don't watch what I eat. It's not like you have Christmas every day!,Adriana Lima,"Day, Every Day, Everything"

"The term 'natural resources' confuses people. 'Natural resources' are not like a finite number of gifts under the Christmas tree. Nature is given, but resources are created.",Alex Tabarrok,"Nature, Tree, People"

"The real reason Jews don't have more Hanukkah music is that, historically, American Jewish singer-songwriters were too busy making Christmas music.

"Christmas cookies can't help but be retro - they are memory first, sugar-flour-egg-redhot-gumdrop-sparkle reality second.",Dana Goodyear,"Reality, Memory, Cookies"
"It's funny how we 'do' Christmas. Christmas is not something that we do, it is something that was done. It celebrates the long awaited arrival of the Messiah, Jesus Christ. We had nothing to do with it, but what we can do is praise God for the coming of the Lord, who washed away the sins of the world by dying on the cross.",Monica Johnson,"Funny, God, Done"
"Christmas is a Christian holiday, and any self-respecting person of another religion should not celebrate a holiday that they don't believe in. Clearly, Christ is in the name of the holiday, so there should be a belief in Him.",Monica Johnson,"Religion, Celebrate, Believe"
"During the holiday season, Christmas specifically, it can be hard to be away from family and friends.",Monica Johnson,"Family, Hard, Holiday"
A Christian's celebration of Christmas should be a lot different from that of nonbelievers.,Monica Johnson,"Christian, Different, Should"
"There's a lot of movies that aren't all about Christmas, or where Christmas isn't the focus, but have that spirit of Christmas in them.

"I think 'Elf' is funny, with Will Ferrell. That's a great Christmas movie.",Robert Osborne,"Funny, Great, Will"
"We are each one on a road going toward home, but we're not trying to get there for Christmas. We're trying to get there for eternity. We want to arrive home safely to our loving Father in Heaven.

"Like my best friend, I asked for drums for Christmas, and got them. But when he moved on to guitar, I realized two things: (1) guitar is a much more expressive instrument, (2) way more girls pay attention to guitar players than to drummers.",Greg Iles,"Best, Guitar, Way"
"Adults are tempted to produce and perform Christmas for their kids and their families, and they arrive at Christmas Day weary and disillusioned.",Ann Voskamp,"Day, Weary, Kids"
A simplified Christmas isn't about circumstances as much as it is about focus.,Ann Voskamp,"Focus, Circumstances, Much"
