I have to give it credit for that.",Olivia Culpo,"Beautiful, Confidence, Yourself"

We didn't start allowing women until five years after our debut. ODB used to get mad.",Rza,"Start, Mad, Old"
"Within a culture possessed by the myth of feminine evil, the naming, describing, and theorizing about good and evil has constituted a maze/haze of deception.

"In 1995, I proposed the Harvard Arts Medal. The idea was to celebrate the fact that, although it's rare, Harvard men and women do go into the creative arts.

"Sports exact too harsh a toll on our beautiful women. Like engendered species, they should be protected, and instead, we exploit them and demand they fly too close to the sun for our amusement.

"It's no big secret that 'thinking' women, since they are already gifted with fully functioning brains, are more than happy to have a yummy not-so-smart man in their lives. All we ask for is a sense of humor, a sense of hygiene, and the sense to not cheat.",Andrea Jeremiah,"Humor, Man, Thinking"
"I have a traditional Catholic personal position, but I am very strongly supportive that women should make these decisions and government shouldn't intrude. I'm a strong supporter of Roe v.

What made women's labour particularly attractive to the capitalists was not only its lower price but also the greater submissiveness of women.,Clara Zetkin,"Attractive, Price, Only"

"Think of Virginia Woolf, 'A Room of One's Own' - that's what women have always needed under patriarchy and can't be creative without.

Boxing is the most beautiful thing after women.,Canelo Alvarez,"Beautiful, Most Beautiful, Boxing"
"It's only recently women got to be action heroes on TV. Progress is slow, and often non-existent. There's plenty of cool comics with female characters... But all it takes is one Catwoman to set the cause back a decade.",Joss Whedon,"Cool, Progress, Action"
One thing standing in the way of further progress for many men is the same obstacle that held women back for so long: overinvestment in their gender identity instead of their individual personhood.,Stephanie Coontz,"Men, Progress, Long"

"There is no such thing as low maintenance or high maintenance, just a bunch of women hoping for a capable mechanic.",Liz Vassey,"Mechanic, Capable, Maintenance"
"I seem to be getting a lot of things pushed my way that are strong women. It's like people see Hackers and they send me offers to play tough women with guns, the kind who wear no bra and a little tank top. I'd like to play strong women who are also very feminine.",Angelina Jolie,"Me, Way, Guns"

"For the several thousands of years before they became firefighters and physicians, women were sirens, enchantresses, snares. At times it seems as if female powerlessness is male self-preservation in disguise.

"Men always want and love when women wear tight and fitted clothing, right? And you're like, 'Wow, she looks so beautiful.' And then you have men who dress like slobs, and you're like, 'What's the deal with these big and baggy suits.' It's pretty ridiculous.",Tom Brady,"Love, Men, Beautiful"

"Most women have jobs that require them to leave the house. A cat is actually a perfect pet. You get the love and companionship of a creature covered in fur, and you don't have to take it for a walk, and it can feed itself. Less maintenance. Surely any man can appreciate the practicality of this choice.",Iliza Shlesinger,"Love, Pet, Walk"
"The idea that women are innately gentle is a fantasy, and a historically recent one. Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction, is depicted as wreathed in male human skulls; the cruel entertainments of the Romans drew audiences as female as they were male; Boudicca led her British troops bloodily into battle.",Naomi Wolf,"Battle, Goddess, Gentle"
"I'm really interested in women, particularly the kind of black woman who has overcome obstacles in her life and transformed.",Mickalene Thomas,"Life, Obstacles, Black"
"I first heard of General Anders and his army more than 50 years ago.

"Women are systematically degraded by receiving the trivial attentions which men think it manly to pay to the sex, when, in fact, men are insultingly supporting their own superiority.",Mary Wollstonecraft,"Men, Sex, Own"
"It's kind of the yin and yang that fascinate me. That for all the evil men do, there are also people who work obnoxiously long hours and sacrifice their personal lives because it is a calling - if they don't keep our streets safe, if they aren't there to advocate for and save beaten women and children and murder victims, who will?",Lisa Gardner,"Work, Men, Sacrifice"

"Because society would rather we always wore a pretty face, women have been trained to cut off anger.",Nancy Friday,"Society, Anger, Always"
"Today when I think about diversity, I actually think about the word 'inclusion.' And I think this is a time of great inclusion. It's not men, it's not women alone. Whether it's geographic, it's approach, it's your style, it's your way of learning, the way you want to contribute, it's your age - it is really broad.",Ginni Rometty,"Alone, Learning, Time"
"I don't see women and think of them as competition or with judgment. Women really move me. I feel connected to all kinds of women.

"Women are half the population of the world, and yet there are so few female characters on-screen.",Geena Davis,"World, Half, Population"

"Equality for men and women, across the world, not only in sports, is the goal. We obviously have a long way to go, but every little bit helps.",Venus Williams,"Equality, Sports, Men"
"For a time, I believed not in God nor Santa Claus, but in mermaids.
