"I've never tried to be accepted. When everyone is doing one thing, I've always had the instinct to go the other way. I don't understand how an individual with their own mind, their own values, and their own beliefs can be so willing to just follow what everybody else is doing. How can you make history doing what everybody else is doing?",Damon Dash,"Always, Mind, Doing"
"'Years of Living Dangerously' is a wonderful opportunity to reach a lot of people with the story and importance of climate change in our lives; in recent history, there's no bigger threat to the quality of human life than what is taking place right now in respect of climate change.",Harrison Ford,"Life, Change, Respect"
"Mention the name George W. Bush in mixed company, and you're likely to spark a lot of debate and emotion - hot and cold, good and bad. Not a lot of neutral reaction.

"The refusal to accept that the black presence in Britain has a long and deep history is not just a symptom of racism, it is a form of racism. It is part of a rearguard and increasingly unsustainable defence of a fantasy monochrome version of British history.",David Olusoga,"Long, Racism, Black"
"Love is the whole history of a woman's life, it is but an episode in a man's.",Madame de Stael,"Life, Love, Love Is"

"Like all major transitions in human history, the shift from a linear to a circular economy will be a tumultuous one.

"Oh, do not read history, for that I know must be false.",Robert Walpole,"Know, Must, False"

There is the old proverb that reads, 'You can't know where you're going if you don't know where you've been'. For me, history is like that. When you take history and combine it with myth, then you get mystery.",Ashwin Sanghi,"Believe, Past, Me"

Everyone would like to believe that anyone possibly exposed to a serious contagious disease would comply with self-quarantine requirements. But history teaches a different lesson.,Sharyl Attkisson,"Believe, Serious, Everyone"
"You need the past as a guideline. The history of music is a good basis, but to escape that stuff, that tortuous rulebook, you have to learn it first. It's kind of like religion - once you've written the Bible, that's it, move on.",John Lydon,"Good, Religion, Music"

"I believe history will come to view 9/11 as an event on par with November 22, 1963, the date on which John F. Kennedy was murdered, cutting short a presidency that was growing ever more promising.

Black history won't stop no bullets.,Afeni Shakur,"Black, Stop, Black History"
History is a relay of revolutions.,Saul Alinsky,"Relay, Revolutions"
