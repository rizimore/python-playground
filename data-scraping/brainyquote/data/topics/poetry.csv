"To design is much more than simply to assemble, to order, or even to edit: it is to add value and meaning, to illuminate, to simplify, to clarify, to modify, to dignify, to dramatize, to persuade, and perhaps even to amuse.

"I sometimes wish I had been educated a Catholic, in order to unite the poetry of religion with its higher principles. Are they necessarily inseparable?

"Art is a form of experience of the person, the place, the history of the people, and as black people, we are different.

It's reflected in the music, the dance, the poetry, and the art.",Faith Ringgold,"History, Experience, Art"
"Poetry, being supremely useless, by its very existence represents a protest against the so-called 'real world' of busy-ness and moneymaking, so we must embrace, salute and support our poets.",Tom Hodgkinson,"World, Support, Useless"

The music just tends to be a vehicle for that poetry.,Mark Knopfler,"Music, Vehicle, Just"
"Poetry may make us from time to time a little more aware of the deeper, unnamed feelings which form the substratum of our being, to which we rarely penetrate; for our lives are mostly a constant evasion of ourselves.",T. S. Eliot,"Time, Feelings, May"
"When I first heard Bob Dylan, I'll be honest, I didn't like him. But I was shallow of mind and didn't understand the poetry. I just judged him on his singing and his guitar playing.",Jose Feliciano,"Mind, Guitar, Singing"
"In Lithuania, I am known as a poet, and they don't care about my cinema. In Europe, they don't know my poetry; in Europe, I am a filmmaker. But here, in the United States, I am only a maverick!",Jonas Mekas,"Cinema, I Am, Care"
"Rational intelligence is dangerous and leads to ratiocination. The painter is a medium who doesn't realize what he is doing.

"Poetry is simply the most beautiful, impressive, and widely effective mode of saying things.",Matthew Arnold,"Communication, Beautiful, Most Beautiful"

"My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.",Wilfred Owen,"War, Pity, Subject"

It is written on the arched sky; it looks out from every star. It is the poetry of Nature; it is that which uplifts the spirit within us.,John Ruskin,"Nature, Sky, Spirit"
"It's always good when women win things in fiction because it tends to be more male-dominated, unlike poetry, which is more equal.",Carol Ann Duffy,"Women, Good, Always"

"Read something of interest every day - something of interest to you, not to your teacher or your best friend or your minister/rabbi/priest. Comics count. So does poetry. So do editorials in your school newspaper. Or a biography of a rock star. Or an instructional manual. Or the Bible.",Jane Yolen,"Best, Teacher, Bible"
"I don't like the word 'poetry,' and I don't like poetry readings, and I usually don't like poets. I would much prefer describing myself and what I do as: I'm kind of a curator, and I'm kind of a night-owl reporter.",Tom Waits,"Myself, Much, Reporter"
I love to write poetry.,Shayne Ward,"Love, Write, I Love"
"I think the novel is not so much a literary genre, but a literary space, like a sea that is filled by many rivers. The novel receives streams of science, philosophy, poetry and contains all of these; it's not simply telling a story.",Jose Saramago,"Science, Space, Sea"
Dancing is the poetry of the foot.,John Dryden,"Dancing, Foot"

"It could be that all awful dictators are frustrated artists - Mao with his poetry and Mussolini with his monuments. Stalin was once a journalistic hack, and I can personally testify to how frustrated they are. Pol Pot left a very edgy photo collection behind. And Osama seems quite interested in video.",P. J. O'Rourke,"Monuments, I Can, Behind"
"Plot, rules, nor even poetry, are not half so great beauties in tragedy or comedy as a just imitation of nature, of character, of the passions and their operations in diversified situations.",Horace Walpole,"Nature, Great, Character"
"To know anything of a poet but his poetry is, so far as the poetry is concerned, to know something that may be entertaining, even delightful, but is certainly inessential.",John Drinkwater,"Know, May, Anything"
"If you have so earth-creeping a mind that it cannot lift itself up to look to the sky of poetry... thus much curse I must send you, in the behalf of all poets, that while you live, you live in love, and never get favour for lacking skill of a sonnet; and, when you die, your memory die from the earth for want of an epitaph.",Philip Sidney,"Love, Sky, Your"
"Poetry is a call to action, and it also is action.",Juan Felipe Herrera,"Action, Call, Also"

Eloquence is the poetry of prose.,William Cullen Bryant,"Prose, Eloquence"
"I define poetry as celebration and confrontation. When we witness something, are we responsible for what we witness? That's an on-going existential question. Perhaps we are and perhaps there's a kind of daring, a kind of necessary energetic questioning. Because often I say it's not what we know, it's what we can risk discovering.",Yusef Komunyakaa,"Know, Something, Risk"

I find a lot of poetry to be narcissistic.,Joni Mitchell,"Find, Lot, Narcissistic"

"When I met Bob Dylan, I was definitely impressed. This guy had come from the American folk world, but he was very schooled in poetry, too. He'd studied the Beat poets, of course.

"'Sunshine Superman' was a pioneering work that for the first time presented a fusion of Celtic, jazz, folk, rock, and Indian music as well as poetry.",Donovan,"Work, Time, Music"

"I was already writing poetry, so I transitioned from writing poetry a cappella to writing over beats, and it was way more exciting to me that way.",Saweetie,"Me, Way, Writing"

"But every great scripture, whether Hebrew, Indian, Persian, or Chinese, apart from its religious value will be found to have some rare and special beauty of its own; and in this respect the original Bible stands very high as a monument of sublime poetry and of artistic prose.",Lafcadio Hearn,"Beauty, Respect, Great"
"Rap and spoken word have reawakened the country to poetry in itself. Texting and Twitter encourage creative uses of casual language, in ways I have celebrated widely. But we've fallen behind on savoring the formal layer of our language.",John McWhorter,"Language, Country, Casual"
"We make out of the quarrel with others, rhetoric, but of the quarrel with ourselves, poetry.",William Butler Yeats,"Others, Make, Rhetoric"
"The major poets of New Jersey have all suffered, whether it's Whitman, who lost his job for 'Leaves of Grass,' or William Carlos Williams, who was called a communist, or Ginsberg, whose 'Howl' was prosecuted, or myself. If you practise poetry the way I think it needs to be done, you're going to put yourself in jeopardy.",Amiri Baraka,"Myself, Done, Yourself"

Poetry is truth in its Sunday clothes.,Joseph Roux,"Truth, Clothes, Sunday"

I could no more define poetry than a terrier can define a rat.,A. E. Housman,"Rat, More, Define"
"I spent many years in college studying English literature. I was on the verge of attending grad school to get a Ph.D. in Renaissance poetry - my lost careers were being a writer, artist, or academic. Do I regret spending all that time poring over Shakespeare when I could have been getting a jump start on the competition? Not at all.",Caterina Fake,"Time, Regret, Competition"

"It would probably surprise people to know that I'm interested in wildlife. I read a lot of poetry, too.",Sean Bean,"Surprise, Know, People"

"Art: If the object of poetry is, to make men, then poetry is the heir of prophecy.",Muhammad Iqbal,"Art, Men, Make"
"You know, in my music career there was a moment where the irony was just so heavy. There were people in my audience that were the reason I developed neuroses. These people that tortured my life were using my art, my poetry, as fuel for them, to torture other people.",Fred Durst,"Life, Art, Music"

"The muse, the beloved, and duende are three ways of thinking of what is the source of poetry, and all three seem to me different names or different ways to think about something that is not entirely reasonable, not entirely subject to the will, not entirely rational.",Edward Hirsch,"Thinking, Me, Will"
"Poetry always, always, always is a key piece of democracy.",Eileen Myles,"Always, Democracy, Key"
"One culture I find fascinating to juxtapose against American culture is the culture of Germany.

It's still a topic of everyday conversation in Germany.",Chris Jordan,"Politics, Art, War"

"Well you can't teach the poetry, but you can teach the craft.",David Hockney,"Well, Craft, Teach"
"There is no gender to my music. There's no male or female voice, no trite lyrics or poetry. It's much more abstract, so it lives with you longer.",Yanni,"Music, Voice, Gender"
"Poetry always runs away from you - it's very difficult to grasp it, and every time you read it, depending on your conditions, you will have a different grasp of it. Whereas with a novel, once you have read it, you have grasped it.",Abbas Kiarostami,"Time, Always, Your"

"I write poetry, and I put it to a beat - I mean, that's what they call rap.",Lakeith Stanfield,"Beat, Mean, Rap"
"Lyric poetry is, of course, musical in origin. I do know that what happened to poetry in the twentieth century was that it began to be written for the page.

"In all my work, in the movies I write, the lyrics, the poetry, the prose, the essays, I am saying that we may encounter many defeats - maybe it's imperative that we encounter the defeats - but we are much stronger than we appear to be and maybe much better than we allow ourselves to be. Human beings are more alike than unalike.",Maya Angelou,"Work, Movies, Better"
"An experienced reader uses the poem as an agent of inquiry. This makes poetry very exciting, unstable, and interactive.",John Barton,"Exciting, Unstable, Inquiry"

"No poetry that I'm aware of, however bad or glorious, has ever left somebody a worse person than they were before they read it.",Felix Dennis,"Bad, Person, Worse"
"I was a victim of a stereotype. There were only two of us Negro kids in the whole class, and our English teacher was always stressing the importance of rhythm in poetry.

I read poetry to save time.,Marilyn Monroe,"Time, Save, Read"

I wish you would read a little poetry sometimes. Your ignorance cramps my conversation.,Anthony Hope,"Your, Ignorance, Sometimes"
The decision to write in prose instead of poetry is made more by the readers than by writers. Almost no one is interested in reading narrative in verse.,Robert Morgan,"Decision, Reading, More"

Theater and poetry were what helped people stay alive and want to go on living.,Vanessa Redgrave,"Alive, Living, People"
"Short fiction is the medium I love the most, because it requires that I bring everything I've learned about poetry - the concision, the ability to say something as vividly as possible - but also the ability to create a narrative that, though lacking a novel's length, satisfies the reader.",Ron Rash,"Love, Ability, Possible"
"Poetry helps me understand who I am. It helps me understand the world around me. But above all, what poetry has taught me is the fact that I need to embrace mystery in order to be completely human.",Yusef Komunyakaa,"World, I Am, Me"
"I lived a pretty chaotic life. I went to England, and I moved around, and there were a lot of things that I was interested in. I wrote poetry. I took photographs. I was a musician and all sorts of things. Nothing brilliant, but I did all these different things.",Pawel Pawlikowski,"Life, Nothing, Things"
"I didn't read poetry seriously until college, when I really began to devour it in a very intense way. I also discovered that a poet is a maker. Before that, I thought a poet was someone who wrote about his own experiences.",Edward Hirsch,"Way, Own, Someone"

"In fact a lot of them I think are absolute baloney. Those Charles Olsens and people like that. At first I was interested in seeing what they were up to, what they were doing, why they were doing it. They never moved me in the way that one is moved by true poetry.",Norman MacCaig,"Me, Doing, Way"
"Fiction and poetry are my first loves, but the really beautiful lyrical essay can do so much that other forms cannot.",Chris Abani,"Beautiful, First, Much"
"I was a very creative child. I played the saxophone and piano, and I was always writing poetry and stories, or drawing in my notebook.

And in high school, I started to get really into photography and videography and would spend hours working on it.",Kali Uchis,"Myself, Always, Drawing"
"I began my writing life as a poet, so poetry has always been fundamental. I evolved from poetry to journalism to stories to novels. But poetry was always there.",Ben Okri,"Life, Always, Journalism"
"If I'm feeling desperate, I'll go out image-hunting. I'll go to news agents and stand at the rack flicking through magazines or go to second-hand bookshops.

Poetry is indispensable - if I only knew what for.,Jean Cocteau,"Only, Indispensable, Knew"
"I cannot speak for more than an hour exclusively about poetry. At that point, life itself takes over again.",Wislawa Szymborska,"Life, Speak, Point"
"I am not ridiculing verbal mechanisms, dreams, or repressions as origins of poetry; all three of them and more besides may have a great deal to do with it.",Allen Tate,"Dreams, Great, I Am"
"I think I'm a very good reader of poetry, but obviously, like everybody, I have a set of criteria for reading poems, and I'm not shy about presenting them, so if people ask for my critical response to a poem, I tell them what works and why, and what doesn't work and why.",Diane Wakoski,"Work, Good, People"
"The Vietnam War and the Iraq war, in different ways, both made me feel like I could not not address them. I'm very doubtful about the usefulness of poetry to do that.",Robert Hass,"War, Me, Feel"

"We are looking to brands for poetry and for spirituality, because we're not getting those things from our communities or from each other.",Naomi Klein,"Looking, Things, Because"
"I think rap music is rap music. I mean, are there heavy writing aspects of it? Absolutely. In a sense, is it poetry? Yeah. I've heard that so much, growing up in a house with poetry.

Poetry involves the mysteries of the irrational perceived through rational words.,Vladimir Nabokov,"Words, Through, Rational"
"A lyric, it is true, is the expression of personal emotion, but then so is all poetry, and to suppose that there are several kinds of poetry, differing from each other in essence, is to be deceived by wholly artificial divisions which have no real being.",John Drinkwater,"True, Real, Expression"

"The idea that a poem was a made thing stayed with me, and I decided then that I wanted to be an artist, not just a diarist. So I put myself through a kind of apprenticeship in writing poetry, and I understood even then that my practice as a poet was deeply related to my reading.",Edward Hirsch,"Myself, Me, Practice"
"As human beings, we are the only organisms that create for the sheer stupid pleasure of doing so. Whether it's laying out a garden, composing a new tune on the piano, writing a bit of poetry, manipulating a digital photo, redecorating a room, or inventing a new chili recipe - we are happiest when we are creating.",Gary Hamel,"Stupid, Doing, New"
"I've never written poetry. I'm not a poet, but I think the nearest you get is either the short story or the novella, in that you can't waste a word. There is no hiding place: everything's got to be seen to relate, and the prose counts.",Susan Hill,"Never, Story, Place"

I want to be the best advocate and promoter for poetry that I can be.,Natasha Trethewey,"Best, I Can, Want"
"My first spoken word poem, packed with all the wisdom of a 14-year-old, was about the injustice of being seen as unfeminine.

"Prose, poetry, and drawings stand side by side in a very democratic way in my work.",Gunter Grass,"Work, Stand, Way"
"Without touching my subject I want to come to the moment when, through pure concentration of seeing, the composed picture becomes more made than taken.

"But the gravest difficulty, and perhaps the most important, in poetry meant solely for recitation, is the difficulty of achieving verbal beauty, or rather of making verbal beauty tell.",Lascelles Abercrombie,"Beauty, Important, Tell"

"Suddenly, everyone wanted to talk to me, it seemed. And not about my poetry: it was my dyslexia they were most interested in.",Philip Schultz,"Me, Everyone, Talk"

Then my class wanted to make a film, and one little boy suggested that I write the script.",Eugene Ionesco,"Friendship, Age, Teacher"
There is no Frigate like a book to take us lands away nor any coursers like a page of prancing Poetry.,Emily Dickinson,"Us, Book, Take"
"I got scouted for modeling on the street. I'm such a tomboy - still am.

Then, I was on my third photo shoot ever, and Adam Leech from 'Downtown Abbey' saw me reading poetry and asked me to recite some.",Anya Taylor-Joy,"World, Me, Street"

"I believe in the power of poetry, which gives me reasons to look ahead and identify a glint of light.",Mahmoud Darwish,"Power, Light, Believe"
"I read a lot of poetry, and I love what it does with language. I love music, too, and I think there's probably no coincidence there, that the rhythm of the words is almost as important as the words themselves, and when you can get the two working together, which usually takes me about 20 goes, I feel a huge satisfaction.",Kate Grenville,"Love, Music, Together"
"I started reading seriously after I was in college. I read comic books. I read every 'Power Man' and 'Iron Fist' that ever came out. I had a teacher introduce me to poetry, and that kind of woke me up.",Ross Gay,"Power, Teacher, Man"
"The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry.",Bertrand Russell,"Man, Mathematics, Excellence"
"I don't think I've ever read poetry, ever.",Eminem,"Think, Ever, Read"

"I'm a failed poet. Reading poetry helps me to see the world differently, and I try to infuse my prose with figurative language, which goes against the trend in fiction.",Jesmyn Ward,"World, Me, Try"
I believe that poetry should communicate.,William Jay Smith,"Believe, I Believe That, I Believe"

More modern poetry is written than read.,P. J. O'Rourke,"More, Than, Modern"

"Concrete poets continue to turn out beautiful things, but to me they're more visual than oral, and they almost really belong on the wall rather than in a book. I haven't the least idea of where poetry is going.",James Laughlin,"Beautiful, Me, Beautiful Things"
"I wrote poetry, which got me into lyrics. Stevie Wonder, Carole King, Elton John pulled me into pop. I started singing with a band - just for fun - when I was 17. And pretty soon, I was thinking I could sing pop in English as well as Spanish.",Gloria Estefan,"King, Thinking, Me"
"If you go into a bar in most places in America and even say the word poetry, you'll probably get beaten up. But poetry is a really strong, beautiful form to me, and a lot of innovation in language comes from poetry.",Jim Jarmusch,"Beautiful, Me, Language"
Poetry is a phantom script telling how rainbows are made and why they go away.,Carl Sandburg,"Why, Go, Phantom"
"I wrote poetry before I wrote songs, and T.S. Eliot was my inspiration. I love his honesty and try to bring that to my own songwriting.",Gabrielle Aplin,"Love, Honesty, Try"

"This career essentially chased me down while I was on the spoken-word scene in New York. I kept hearing that my delivery of my poetry - which was very personal and cathartic at the time- was very moving to folks. People thought that I was an actress because of my delivery, when I was just dropping into the work and really pouring out my soul.",Sonja Sohn,"Work, Time, Soul"
"I think of myself as an ambassador of the arts. In my heart of hearts, I know the world would be a more peaceful, tender place if we were more moved by the poetry around us.",Tim Seibles,"Myself, Heart, World"
"I approach video games the same way I approach theatre, filmmaking, poetry, or painting. I wish more people would take that point of view. It would help the industry to move on.",David Cage,"Video Games, View, Painting"
"The business of the poet is not to find new emotions, but to use the ordinary ones and, in working them up into poetry, to express feelings which are not in actual emotions at all.",T. S. Eliot,"Business, Emotions, Feelings"
Dismissals of poetry are nothing new. It's easy to dismiss poetry if one has not read much of it.,Natasha Trethewey,"Nothing, New, Easy"

"I love Sufism as I love beautiful poetry, but it is not the answer. Sufism is like a mirage in the desert. It says to you, come and sit, relax and enjoy yourself for a while.",Naguib Mahfouz,"Love, Beautiful, Relax"
"Alchemy is the art of far and near, and I think poetry is alchemy in that way. It's delightful to distort size, to see something that's tiny as though it were vast.",Robert Morgan,"Art, Way, See"
"As anthropomorphic and surreal people have said my early writing was, to me it was really stock and almost banal in the sense that it was just description, the poetry of comparing: 'Your feet are like A, and your eyes like B.'",Devendra Banhart,"Eyes, Your, Feet"
"There's a fierce practicality and empiricism which the whole imaginative, lyrical aspect of poetry comes from.",David Whyte,"Fierce, Whole, Aspect"
"Poetry, I feel, is a tyrannical discipline. You've got to go so far so fast in such a small space; you've got to burn away all the peripherals.",Sylvia Plath,"Space, Discipline, Feel"
"The idea is to make the script out of a political analysis and then to convey that - sometimes in poetry, sometimes science, sometimes all it takes is a film. The film itself is less and less spectacular because I think very strongly now the more spectacular you are, the more you are absorbed by the things you are trying to destroy.",Jean-Luc Godard,"Science, Political, Sometimes"
"My junior high school teacher, Bennie Williams, was really more than a music teacher. She taught us poetry. She helped us put on school shows.

It's always a combination of physics and poetry that I find inspiring. It's hard to wrap your head around things like the Hubble scope.,Tom Hanks,"Always, Your, Find"
"The middle class is doing fine in fiction. But it's not what gets me going. I love the working class, and everyone from it I've met, and think they're incredibly witty, inventive - there's a lot of poetry there.",Martin Amis,"Love, Me, Doing"
I've written poetry most of my life.,Julia Michaels,"Life, My Life, Most"

"My own, purely personal view is that reading, study, poetry, and scientific experiment might be more rewarding than a job or children, so I would never advise anyone against university if they're going for the right reasons.",Victoria Coren Mitchell,"View, Own, Children"
Poetry carries the imagery which is large enough for the kind of life we want for ourselves.,David Whyte,"Life, Enough, Want"
"Every now and then I read a poem that does touch something in me, but I never turn to poetry for solace or pleasure in the way that I throw myself into prose.",J. K. Rowling,"Myself, Me, Way"
"Slowly poetry becomes visual because it paints images, but it is also musical: it unites two arts into one.",Eugenio Montale,"Visual, Two, Slowly"

I've always been a fan of poetry. I grew up with Lawrence Ferlinghetti and the Beat poets. I really followed that stuff for a while. I just love the way people threw words around like they were painting.,Ric Ocasek,"Love, Always, Painting"
"When you write, it's just a much more crystalline, compressed version of the voice you think with - though not the one you speak with. I think your writing voice is your laser-guided missile. It's the poetry part of you.",Douglas Coupland,"Your, Voice, Speak"
"In medicine as well as in romantic poetry, it is the heart that is the center and controlling mechanics of life. If the heart stops, life stops. The loss of sight doesn't not mean death. Yet for ages, the eyes was believed to contain a human being's vital essence - a not wholly irrational belief.",Henry Grunwald,"Life, Death, Romantic"
"By definition, poetry works with qualities and dynamics that mainstream society is reluctant to face head-on. It's an interesting phenomenon that by necessity, poetry is just below the radar.",David Whyte,"Society, Face, Necessity"
I do not go in search of poetry. I wait for poetry to visit me.,Eugenio Montale,"Wait, Me, Search"

I'm conscious of a series of circles working its way through my life. And at this particular moment I have come round to the beginning of my writing cycle. It begins with poetry. There's hardly a day that goes past on which I don't write poetry.,Ben Okri,"Life, Moment, Day"
"As civilization advances, poetry almost necessarily declines.",Thomas Babington Macaulay,"Civilization, Almost, Advances"

"Everybody interprets things differently with their own perception, and I want poetry to pull out of them their own feelings.",John Trudell,"Feelings, Own, Perception"
"The techniques of contemporary poetry are probably the techniques of your daily life. I don't know a single person who goes into the grocery store and thinks in complete sentences.

"Let's detox our cluttered academic brain. That's what the poet does. People call it daydreaming, detoxing our minds and taking care of that clutter. It's being able to let in call letters from the poetry universe.",Juan Felipe Herrera,"Brain, Universe, Care"
Music is closer to poetry than anything.,John McLaughlin,"Music, Anything, Closer"
I love poetry and I've kept everything I've written.,Neil Warnock,"Love, Everything, Kept"

"After a couple of years of public high school, I went to Exeter - an insane conglomeration of adolescent males in the wilderness, all of whom claimed to hate poetry.",Donald Hall,"Hate, School, Wilderness"

You can make poems out of anger as well as tenderness. You can make poetry out of anything. It can be the ugliest of emotions. It doesn't have to be sweetness and light.,Tony Harrison,"Anger, Light, Emotions"
Gil Thorpe is a great diversion and is to book writing as poetry is to prose.,Jerry B. Jenkins,"Great, Book, Writing"

"I joined the army on my seventeenth birthday, full of the romance of war after having read a lot of World War I British poetry and having seen a lot of post-World War II films. I thought the romantic presentations of war influenced my joining and my presentation of war to my younger siblings.",Walter Dean Myers,"Birthday, War, Romantic"

It is certain that at certain times talent entirely overcomes thought or poetry.,John Singer Sargent,"Talent, Thought, Certain"
An age which is incapable of poetry is incapable of any kind of literature except the cleverness of a decadence.,Raymond Chandler,"Age, Literature, Except"

"I began the way nearly everybody I ever heard of - I began writing poetry. And I find that to be quite usual with writers, their trying their hand at poetry.",Shelby Foote,"Way, Find, Trying"

There is no prose in English.",Victor Hugo,"Great, Language, Privilege"

We will never be able to say that we have reached grade eight, or that we have left the grades behind and are now embarked on an advanced training.",James Fenton,"Training, Will, Know"
"What I wanted to do in rock 'n roll was merge poetry with sonic scapes, and the two people who had contributed so much to that were Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison.",Patti Smith,"People, Rock, Much"

We simply have not kept in touch with poetry.,Paul Muldoon,"Touch, Simply, Kept"

"With fiction, I tend to get to my desk and start writing. Poetry I write in my head, often while walking, so that my poems have an organic quality, hopefully.",John Burnside,"Quality, Start, Walking"
"I stay up on current events. I read 'The New Yorker' and 'The Economist.' I go to community meetings to see what concerns the people in my neighborhood. I studied literature in college, so I also continue to read poetry, literature, and novels.",Caterina Fake,"Community, Meetings, New"
"That's another pompous expression that is out of fashion, to say that poetry is a gift. It sounds pompous because you say, 'Who gave you the gift, and what is this gift?' And the gift is where I am; the gift is what I have come out of, the people around me who, I think, are beautiful people.",Derek Walcott,"Beautiful, Gift, I Am"
Shakespeare is a seminal story-teller. I don't think he imagined he was writing classics or that he was writing great poetry. I don't think he dreamt his work would be staged 400 years after he died.,Naseeruddin Shah,"Work, Great, Writing"
I have been enlightened. I have fallen into poetry and it has swallowed me up.,Keith Haring,"Me, Up, Fallen"
I like writing love songs. I really like romantic poetry.,Borns,"Love, Romantic, Writing"
"A play is basically a long, formalistic polemic. You can write it without the poetry, and if you do, you may have a pretty good play. We know this because we see plays in translation. Not many people speak Norwegian or Danish or whatever guys like Ibsen spoke, or Russian - yet we understand Chekhov and the others.",David Mamet,"Good, Long, Know"
"Americans have been tremendously fortunate in poetry, regarding both the quantity and quality of poetry produced. Unfortunately, it remains in schools and universities; it is not widely distributed.",Joseph Brodsky,"Quality, Quantity, Fortunate"
There's something about beautiful moments in sports that alters our experience of time. And I'd say the same thing about poetry and gardening. Gardening slows me down. I want to stop and observe everything.,Ross Gay,"Experience, Time, Sports"
"I love all kinds of music. My dad's from London, so he loves David Bowie, the Stones, The Clash. I grew up with that influence while loving poetry and loving all kinds of current music.",Adam Hicks,"Love, Music, Dad"
"Rap is poetry to music, like beatniks without beards and bongos.",David Lee Roth,"Music, Like, Without"

Anyone reading contemporary poetry - especially contemporary African-American poetry - will quickly see that race is an enduring subject. What some don't realize is just how diverse the handling of that subject is. It's as diverse as blackness.,Terrance Hayes,"Will, Race, Reading"
"Most people read poetry listening for echoes because the echoes are familiar to them. They wade through it the way a boy wades through water, feeling with his toes for the bottom: The echoes are the bottom.",Wallace Stevens,"Water, Way, Listening"
"I began to write poetry in high school, and would ride miles over sandy roads in the fine hills around Cedar Rapids, repeating the lines over and over until I had them right, making some of the rhythm of the horse help.",Paul Engle,"Ride, Roads, School"
"In the United States, in poetry workshops, it's now quite a thing to make graduate students learn poems by heart.",Seamus Heaney,"Heart, Make, Now"
"In a general way, I want to be a kind of flag-waver, bunting hanger-up, drum-beater, you name it, for poetry.",Andrew Motion,"Way, Name, Want"
"I have often said that I think children's books are like poetry. Finding the exact right words to tell a story is something all writers, regardless of genre, are challenged to do, but it is in children's that the art of selection really becomes an art.",Rebecca Serle,"Art, Words, Children"
"On the other hand, if there's an underlying core of poetry that I go to, I go to the sea. I've lived on the sea all my life. I live on the sea in Cape Breton.",Richard Serra,"Life, Sea, My Life"
Leaving college early to play pro football was the best thing that happened to me. I got to drop the most boring poetry class. Dumbest thing I did was being in that class.,John Layfield,"Best, Football, Me"
"Yes, I love poetry, both to read and to write it. A first love.",Peter Heller,"Love, First, First Love"
I guess the thing that I'm most proud of is that I kept on writing poetry. I understand that poetry is sort of the source of everything I do. It's the source of my creativity.,Erica Jong,"Creativity, Proud, Understand"
Prose talks and poetry sings.,Franz Grillparzer,"Prose, Sings, Talks"
"The growth of art seems to be in cycles, and often its vigorous lifetime is restricted to a century or two. The periods of distinctive drama, Greek, English, Spanish, fall within such a limit; the schools of painting and sculpture likewise; and, in poetry, the Victorian age or the school of Pope will serve as examples.",George Edward Woodberry,"Age, Art, Growth"
"While I've had a great distaste for what's usually called song in modern poetry or for what's usually called music, I really don't think of speech as so far from song.",David Antin,"Great, Music, Song"
"Translated poetry filled the no-man's-land between my own work and other writers', and I found this fascinating to explore.",Edwin Morgan,"Work, Own, My Own"
"Poetry has the ability to create entire moments with just a few choice words. The spacing and line breaks create rhythm, a helpful musicality, a natural flow. The separate stanzas aid in perpetuating a kind of incremental reading, one small chunk at a time.",Jason Reynolds,"Time, Words, Ability"
"The poetry of a people comes from the deep recesses of the unconscious, the irrational and the collective body of our ancestral memories.",Margaret Walker,"Memories, Body, People"
"Poetry is something that happens in universities, in creative writing programs or in English departments.",Mark Strand,"Happens, Writing, Something"

The quietest poetry can be an explosion of joy.,James Broughton,"Joy, Explosion"
"I can't understand Urdu, Bahasa or Russian, but when the Pakistani Faiz, the Indonesian Rendra and the Russian Rosdentvensky declaim, I can feel the living throb of rhythm and music, the warmth and passion of their poetry, as do the hundreds, not a mere roomful, of poetry lovers in the audience.",F. Sionil Jose,"Music, Passion, Living"
Translation is an interestingly different way to be involved both with poetry and with the language that I've found myself living in much of the time. I think the two feed each other.,Marilyn Hacker,"Time, Myself, Language"
"I'm not an academic, but I've always loved poetry since I've been small.",Naveen Andrews,"Always, Loved, Small"

"I think that the job of poetry, its political job, is to refresh the idea of justice, which is going dead in us all the time.",Robert Hass,"Time, Justice, Political"
"But I liked Yeats! That wild Irishman. I really loved his love of language, his flow. His chaotic ideas seemed to me just the right thing for a poet. Passion! He was always on the right side. He may be wrongheaded, but his heart was always on the right side. He wrote beautiful poetry.",Chinua Achebe,"Love, Beautiful, Always"
The applause of his native land is the richest reward to which the patriot ever aspires. It is this for which 'he bears to live or dares to die.' It is the high incentive to those achievements which illustrate the page of history and give to poetry its brightest charm.,John Tyler,"History, Die, Reward"
"The olive branch has been consecrated to peace, palm branches to victory, the laurel to conquest and poetry, the myrtle to love and pleasure, the cypress to mourning, and the willow to despondency.",Dorothea Dix,"Love, Peace, Victory"
"I am a patriot, but I must say that English poetry is the richest in the world.",Joseph Brodsky,"World, I Am, Patriot"
"'Milk and Honey' was written with me being honest to myself, kind of pulling at the things that I hear the most and saying that out loud, and you know, that thing that we hear the most is most universal, and so that rings true with all folks. The language used in the poetry is extremely, extremely accessible.",Rupi Kaur,"Myself, Me, Honey"
"I wanted to be a poet. I fell in love with poetry around eight years old, but not through literature. Instead, it came through hip-hop lyrics and my obsession with reading liner notes. Queen Latifah's 'Black Reign' is the album that stands out the most.",Jason Reynolds,"Love, Queen, Black"
"I think we will always have the impulse towards visual poetry with us, and I wouldn't agree with Bly that it's a bad thing. It depends on the ability of the individual poet to do it well, and to make a shape which is interesting enough to hold your attention.",James Laughlin,"Always, Your, Will"
I think we fool ourselves and really negate a great deal of history if we think that the oral history of poetry is shorter than the written history of poetry. It's not true. Poetry has a longer oral tradition than it does written.,Saul Williams,"History, Great, Fool"

"Many attempts have been made by writers on art and poetry to define beauty in the abstract, to express it in the most general terms, to find some universal formula for it.",Walter Pater,"Beauty, Art, Find"
"If there's no money in poetry, neither is there poetry in money.",Robert Graves,"Money, Neither"

Poetry is life distilled.,Gwendolyn Brooks,"Life, Distilled"

"The whole thing about making films in an organic film on location is that it's not all about characters, relationships and themes, it's also about place and the poetry of place. It's about the spirit of what you find, the accidents of what you stumble across.",Mike Leigh,"Find, Accidents, Place"
"In these days of our new materialistic Irish state, poetry will have a harder, less picturesque task. But the loss of Yeats and all that boundless activity, in a country where the mind is feared and avoided, leaves a silence which it is painful to contemplate.",Austin Clarke,"Silence, Mind, Will"
When you write poetry you are always addressing the world somehow.,John Cooper Clarke,"Always, World, Write"
"Poetry is of so subtle a spirit, that in the pouring out of one language into another it will evaporate.",John Denham,"Will, Language, Spirit"

"I'm happy to be a writer - of prose, poetry, every kind of writing. Every person in the world who isn't a recluse, hermit or mute uses words. I know of no other art form that we always use.",Maya Angelou,"Art, Always, World"
"The charge frequently leveled against poetry - that it is difficult, obscure, hermetic and whatnot - indicates not the state of poetry but, frankly, the rung of the evolutionary ladder on which society is stuck.",Joseph Brodsky,"Society, Difficult, Ladder"
"If what distinguishes us from other species is speech, then poetry, which is the supreme linguistic operation, is our anthropological - indeed, genetic - goal.",Joseph Brodsky,"Speech, Us, Linguistic"
Writing criticism is to writing fiction and poetry as hugging the shore is to sailing in the open sea.,John Updike,"Sea, Criticism, Open"

"And, I mean, I think poetry does need to be met to some extent, especially, I guess, 19th century poetry, and for me, it's just been so worth the effort. It's like I'm planting a garden in my head.",Jane Campion,"Effort, Me, Garden"
"As things are, and as fundamentally they must always be, poetry is not a career, but a mug's game. No honest poet can ever feel quite sure of the permanent value of what he has written: He may have wasted his time and messed up his life for nothing.",T. S. Eliot,"Life, Time, Always"
Poetry remembers that it was an oral art before it was a written art.,Jorge Luis Borges,"Art, Before, Written"

"Poetry is, first and last, language - the rest is filler.",Mark Strand,"Rest, Language, First"

"I think that there is nothing, not even crime, more opposed to poetry, to philosophy, ay, to life itself than this incessant business.",Henry David Thoreau,"Life, Business, Nothing"

"It's something we, guys, have all done. Made tapes for girls, trying to impress them, to meet them on a shared plane of aesthetics. Read them someone else's poetry because they do poetry better than you could do it, because you're too awkward to do it.",John Cusack,"Done, Better, Trying"
"Unfortunately, poetry is not born in noise, in crowds, or on a bus. There have to be four walls and the certainty that the telephone will not ring. That's what writing is all about.",Wislawa Szymborska,"Will, Born, Ring"
"Every age has its own poetry; in every age the circumstances of history choose a nation, a race, a class to take up the torch by creating situations that can be expressed or transcended only through poetry.",Jean-Paul Sartre,"History, Age, Own"
"I find a lot of poetry very disappointing, but I do have poets that I go back to. One book of poetry that I'd like to mention is 'The Exchange' by Sophie Cabot Black. Her poems are difficult without being too difficult.",Billy Collins,"Black, Difficult, Find"

"We have a motto at Naropa: 'Keep the world safe for poetry.' It's humorous but has some real bite to it. If the world is safe for poetry, it can be safe for many other things.",Anne Waldman,"World, Keep, Motto"
"Lucknow, as far as I have heard, is always known for its culture, literature and poetry. So it has set a cultural benchmark for the entire country.",Zeenat Aman,"Always, Culture, Country"

"Poetry is necessary, but is the poet?",Carlos Drummond de Andrade,"Necessary, Poet"
"For me, movies and television are interesting because they are the dominant storytelling form of our time. My first love will always be fiction, and especially novels, but I'm a writer...

Poetry at its best can do you a lot of harm.,Sylvia Plath,"Best, Harm, Lot"
"The drama is complete poetry. The ode and the epic contain it only in germ; it contains both of them in a state of high development, and epitomizes both.",Victor Hugo,"Development, Drama, High"
I don't think you can define how you acquire your imagination any more than you can define why one person has a sense of humor and another doesn't. But I certainly would lean to the side that says all those solitary hours of daydreaming were a kind of training for poetry.,James Tate,"Humor, Imagination, Your"
"The commonest error made in relation to poetry is that it consists simply in verse-making. Many confound the casket of meter and rhyme with the jewel of thought which it encloses, and, perhaps, in some instances, after close investigation, they have found the casket empty and turned away with feelings of disappointment and disgust.",Orson F. Whitney,"Disappointment, Feelings, Empty"
"Poetry must have something in it that is barbaric, vast and wild.",Denis Diderot,"Wild, Something, Must"

Poetry has been to me its own exceeding great reward; it has given me the habit of wishing to discover the good and beautiful in all that meets and surrounds me.,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,"Good, Great, Beautiful"

It is a way we reassess our past. We can do that in poetry in ways we can't do in prose.,Peter Davison,"Past, Way, Prose"

"A man of eighty has outlived probably three new schools of painting, two of architecture and poetry and a hundred in dress.",Lord Byron,"Architecture, Man, Dress"
"Poetry fettered, fetters the human race. Nations are destroyed or flourish in proportion as their poetry, painting, and music are destroyed or flourish.",William Blake,"Music, Painting, Race"
"Writing poetry makes you intensely conscious of how words sound, both aloud and inside the head of the reader. You learn the weight of words and how they sound to the ear.",Helen Dunmore,"Words, Sound, Head"
"Poetry is a sword of lightning, ever unsheathed, which consumes the scabbard that would contain it.",Percy Bysshe Shelley,"Sword, Lightning, Which"
"When I was young, I struggled with authorship: with everything the word meant and failed to mean. Irish poetry was heavy with custom. Sometimes at night, when I tried to write, a ghost hand seemed to hold mine. Where could my life, my language fit in?",Eavan Boland,"Life, Night, My Life"
"Poetry is but another form of inquiry into the nature of phenomena, using with its own unique procedures and tools.",John Barton,"Nature, Unique, Own"
"Those who say we should dismantle the role of Poet Laureate altogether, the trick they miss is that being called this thing, with the weight of tradition behind it, and with the association of the Royal family, does allow you to have conversations and to open doors, and wallets, for the good of poetry in a way that nothing else would allow.",Andrew Motion,"Family, Good, Nothing"
"I aspire to a poetry of great formal integrity, deep passion and high intellect, and I have many models for how to do that.",Edward Hirsch,"Great, Integrity, Passion"

"On a summer night it can be lovely to sit around outside with friends after dinner and, yes, read poetry to each other. Keats and Yeats will never let you down, but it's differently exciting to read the work of poets who are still walking around out there.",Michael Cunningham,"Work, Dinner, Night"
"Local images have one kind of reality. 'U.S. 1' will, I hope, have that kind and another, too. Poetry can extend the document.",Muriel Rukeyser,"Hope, Reality, Will"

Not every gay person recites poetry or has read Keats. You can get readers through anything if the characters are complicated. You can't dismiss Josey Wales' quite liberal worldview.,Marlon James,"Gay, Person, Complicated"

We are supposed to write poetry to keep the gods alive.,Jim Harrison,"Keep, Alive, Gods"
"On the subject of literary genres, I've always felt that my response to poetry is inadequate. I'd love to be the kind of person that drifts off into the garden with a slim volume of Elizabethan verse or a sheaf of haikus, but my passion is story.",J. K. Rowling,"Love, Always, Passion"
Why should poetry have to make sense?,Charlie Chaplin,"Why, Make, Sense"

"Poetry should be able to reach everybody, and it should be able to appeal to all levels of understanding.",Peter Davison,"Understanding, Reach, Appeal"

"A verbal art like poetry is reflective; it stops to think. Music is immediate, it goes on to become.",W. H. Auden,"Art, Music, Think"

It is very difficult to explain poetry. You have to understand the poetry and figure out your own take and your relatability.,Shoojit Sircar,"Your, Difficult, Own"
"I liked Yeats! That wild Irishman. I really loved his love of language, his flow. His chaotic ideas seemed to me just the right thing for a poet. Passion! He was always on the right side. He may be wrongheaded, but his heart was always on the right side. He wrote beautiful poetry.",Chinua Achebe,"Love, Beautiful, Always"

"I think the first time I really heard poetry was in the schoolyard. Just the little limericks that kids say when they're jumping rope and playing games.

"And at some point I would like to talk my publisher into doing an anthology of my poetry alongside some teen readers' poetry. It would be fun, and really wonderful to get their stuff out there.",Ellen Hopkins,"Teen, Doing, Fun"

"My idea is simply - is very simple - is that the books of poetry should be published in far greater volume and be distributed in far greater volume, in far more substantial manner. You can sell in supermarkets very cheaply. In paperbacks. You can sell in drugstores.",Joseph Brodsky,"Simple, Far, More"
"Hence poetry is something more philosophic and of graver import than history, since its statements are rather of the nature of universals, whereas those of history are singulars.",Aristotle,"Nature, History, Something"

"Cut quarrels out of literature, and you will have very little history or drama or fiction or epic poetry left.",Robert Staughton Lynd,"History, Will, Literature"

"Drawing is a way of coming upon the connection between things, just like metaphor in poetry reconnects what has become separated.",John Berger,"Connection, Way, Drawing"

"I think there's a certain poetry to having your body reflect what you feel inside of you. Perhaps you have a feeling that's so pure, or overwhelming inside of you that your body disfigures to it - contortions match your confusion.",Arca,"Your, Body, Feel"

"Frankly, writing poetry for children is plain old fun, and I consider myself blessed to have such a delightful career.",Jack Prelutsky,"Myself, Blessed, Children"

"One of the things that distinguishes poetry from ordinary speech is that in a very few number of words, poetry captures some kind of deep feeling, and rhythm is the way to get there. Rhythm is the way the poetry carries itself.",Edward Hirsch,"Way, Words, Feeling"
I despair of ever writing excellent poetry.,Isaac Rosenberg,"Despair, Writing, Ever"

"Poetry is the art of substantiating shadows, and of lending existence to nothing.",Edmund Burke,"Art, Nothing, Shadows"

"So the best way to understand poetry, which is made by men, is to imitate, and that goes back to making work as a kind of doorway into new work, as opposed to making work as a mirror of the old work.",Terrance Hayes,"Work, Best, Men"
"There are better ways we can transform this virulent hatred - by living our ideals, the Peace Corps, exchange students, teachers, exporting our music, poetry, blue jeans.",Helen Thomas,"Peace, Music, Better"

"Lately, I've been thinking about the difference between poetry and prose, and as I've experienced it, poetry is insistent. It allows for images and statements to operate in a single space and resonate powerfully without the application to be elaborated upon and narrated.",Tracy K. Smith,"Space, Thinking, Difference"
"To me, poetry is spoken - not exclusively, but there's a mix of languages in it. That's what I liked about 'For the Confederate Dead;' it has many different tones to it.",Kevin Young,"Me, Dead, Different"
"The biggest problem is people are afraid of poetry, think they can't understand it or that it will be boring.",Caroline Kennedy,"Boring, Will, People"
"I never thought I'd be doing poetry books. I never really studied poetry. But the first one I did was after my mother died, and I realized that people sort of think and talk about her style and fashion, but in fact, what made her the person she was was really her love of reading and ideas.",Caroline Kennedy,"Love, Doing, Style"
"When the modern movement began, starting perhaps with the paintings of Manet and the poetry of Baudelaire and Rimbaud, what distinguished the modern movement was the enormous honesty that writers, painters and playwrights displayed about themselves. The bourgeois novel flinches from such notions.",J. G. Ballard,"Honesty, Movement, About"
"Opera combines pretty basic theater and poetry, but the storyline itself is actually quite poetic and, after some digital research, taking that actual content and seeing it as undeniably poetic.",John Darnielle,"Research, Digital, Opera"

"A glance at the history of European poetry is enough to inform us that rhyme itself is not indispensable.

"People wish to be poets more than they wish to write poetry, and that's a mistake. One should wish to celebrate more than one wishes to be celebrated.",Lucille Clifton,"Celebrate, Mistake, People"

The sources of poetry are in the spirit seeking completeness.,Muriel Rukeyser,"Spirit, Seeking, Sources"

"I'm about 75 pages into a book on poetry. I don't know if anybody wants to read it. It's on any broad variety of subjects.

"All good poetry is forged slowly and patiently, link by link, with sweat and blood and tears.",Lord Alfred Douglas,"Good, Sweat, Tears"
"And I know I'm supposed to feel guilty for wanting people to buy my books... and books in general? Novels and poetry, they belong to the realm of art. How dirty of us to try to hawk art! But, after a decade of hand-wringing and apologies, I can't quite muster the guilt anymore.",Julianna Baggott,"Art, Try, Know"
"The obsessions of others are opaque to the unobsessed, and thus easy to mock. NASCAR, jazz, baseball, roses, poetry, quilts, fishing. If we're lucky, we all have at least one.",Roberta Smith,"Fishing, Jazz, Easy"

I've written some poetry I don't understand myself.,Carl Sandburg,"Myself, Understand, Some"
The first thing I tried to do in the months after losing my mother was to write a poem. I found myself turning to poetry in the way so many people do - to make sense of losses.

The tradition of Russian literature is also an eastern tradition of learning poetry and prose by heart.,Ryszard Kapuscinski,"Learning, Heart, Literature"
"I became a very passionate Christian when I was 17. I started writing and performing poetry at different venues across the U.K. I started performing from then, really.",Michaela Coel,"Writing, Christian, Different"
"Plagiarism has been around far longer than the Internet. In fact, I had a poem published in 'Seventeen' magazine when I was 15 years old.

Stylized acting and direction is to realistic acting and direction as poetry is to prose.,Elia Kazan,"Direction, Acting, Realistic"
"The last thing a young artist should do in poetry or any other field is think about what's in style, what's current, what are the trends.

Try to make a poem that has some of those qualities.",Robert Pinsky,"Music, Architecture, Look"
"I developed a definition - which I think becomes less and less accurate as poetry moves into the world - that poetry was a way of speaking to the world, but fiction was a way to get the world to speak to me.",Grace Paley,"World, Me, Way"

"Nobody, I think, ought to read poetry, or look at pictures or statues, who cannot find a great deal more in them than the poet or artist has actually expressed. Their highest merit is suggestiveness.",Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Great, Look, Find"
Rap is rhythm and poetry. Hip-hop is storytelling and poetry as well.,Ajay Naidu,"Hip-Hop, Well, Rhythm"

The iambic pentameter owes its pre-eminence in English poetry to its genius for variation. Good blank verse does not sound like a series of identically measured lines. It sounds like a series of subtle variations on the same theme.,James Fenton,"Good, Genius, Sound"

Superstition is the poetry of life.,Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,"Life, Superstition"
Poetry is the exquisite expression of exquisite expressions.,Joseph Roux,"Expression, Exquisite, Expressions"

I'm so happy to be an advocate for poetry.,Edward Hirsch,"Happy, Advocate"

"I think Ginsberg has done more harm to the craft that I honor and live by than anybody else by reducing it to a kind of mean that enables the most dubious practitioners to claim they are poets because they think, If the kind of thing Ginsberg does is poetry, I can do that.",James Dickey,"Done, Honor, Live"
"To be under occupation, to be under siege, is not a good inspiration for poetry.",Mahmoud Darwish,"Good, Inspiration, Siege"
"In the language of poetry, where every word is weighed, nothing is usual or normal. Not a single stone and not a single cloud above it. Not a single day and not a single night after it.

"What my character is or how many jails I have lounged in, or wards or walls or wassails, how many lonely-heart poetry readings I have dodged, is beside the point. A man's soul or lack of it will be evident with what he can carve upon a white sheet of paper.",Charles Bukowski,"Character, Man, Soul"
"The poetry of this one is called philosophical, of that one philological, of a third rhetorical, and so on. Which is then the poetic poetry?",Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel,"Rhetorical, Which, Third"

I loved poetry and wrote my first novel when I was 9. It was about a little girl and the people she met in the woods.",Amanda Plummer,"World, Try, Woods"

Poetry is the key to the hieroglyphics of nature.,David Hare,"Nature, Key"

"I was excited by what my painter friends were doing, and they seemed to be interested in our poetry too, and that was a wonderful little, fizzy sort of world.",Kenneth Koch,"World, Doing, Excited"
"Any reflection about poetry should begin, or end, with this question: who and how many read poetry books?",Octavio Paz,"Reflection, End, Who"

"A lot of ancient poetry sees in nature a reflection of human emotions, and in a post-industrialized era, once people have become more aware of the necessity of a more harmonious relation between man and nature, we need to build cities which can connect with human spiritual needs instead of being merely functional.",Ma Yansong,"Nature, Man, Reflection"
"I come from a short fiction background, and my mom is a poet, so I've always read poetry; I've always had a lot of different influences both linguistically and musically.",Lorde,"Mom, Always, Short"

"Otherwise I don't read much adult poetry at all, because I'm not smart enough and mostly I don't get it.",Jack Prelutsky,"Smart, Enough, Much"

The sort of poetry I seek resides in objects man can't touch.,E. M. Forster,"Man, Touch, Objects"

But by the time I was in my 20s, I found myself writing little essays and more poetry - writing at writing.",Maya Angelou,"Time, Myself, Thoughts"
"I grew up in a bookless house - my parents didn't read poetry, so if I hadn't had the chance to experience it at school I'd never have experienced it.

Poetry is the communication through words of certain experiences that can be communicated in no other way.,John Drinkwater,"Communication, Way, Words"
"I have written some songs, but I would really call what I've done poetry at the end of the day, because I'll sit with my guitar for hours and hours on end for, like, a week and then I won't touch it for a month. I also just have no confidence. And you know what? I don't have time, because I'd rather be doing other things, like knitting.",Amanda Seyfried,"Time, Done, Day"

"You watch an old 'Jeopardy!' and the categories alone are very plain. 'Poetry,' or 'Movies,' or 'Physics.'

Lots more jokes, lots more high-concept categories and questions.",Ken Jennings,"Alone, Movies, Physics"

"Thinking in its lower grades, is comparable to paper money, and in its higher forms it is a kind of poetry.",Havelock Ellis,"Money, Thinking, Grades"

"If the poetry world celebrate its female stars at the true level of their productivity and influence, poetry would wind up being a largely female world, and the men would leave.",Eileen Myles,"Men, Celebrate, Stars"

"My cure for writer's block is to step away from the thing I'm stuck on, usually a novel, and write something totally different. Besides fiction, I write poetry, screenplays, essays and journalism.

"My mum is a singer and harpist, and my dad writes fantastic poetry, so we've grown up around a lot of words and music.",Jessie Buckley,"Music, Dad, Words"

"Poetry is as vital as ever. The teaching of poetry reading, however, is sluggish and, often, slovenly. It needs to be expanded in the school curriculum and be more a feature of society at large.

I love poetry - just to read it and be around it.,Scott Glenn,"Love, Just, Around"

"Civic poetry is public poetry. It is political poetry. It is about the hard stuff of life: money, crime, gender, corporate excess, racial injustice.

Smith,"Work, Parents, Generation"
