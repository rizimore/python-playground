I need that aggressive attitude to play my music and more men have that attitude than women.,Lita Ford,"Women, Men, Music"

"The enemies of acting are mood and attitude and other general homogenized disruptive entities. Whereas acting is about action - doing - and unless you can figure out a way to craft in an imaginative reality to which you don't submit, you're going to be out of control. You'll flip out.
