"We all can do our part to address America's anger mismanagement crisis. And for us Christians, it starts with a little more faith, hope, and love.",Eric Metaxas,"Love, Faith, Hope"

"For me, boxing was a way of me exercising my frustration, anger, sense of injustice, but also a way of owning my space and taking up space.

"Once in a while, I still witness occasionally sexist behavior and comments from men (which experience has taught me you should always deflect with humour rather than anger).

I just put my anger and resentment into basketball. Even the stuff from my childhood.,Gilbert Arenas,"Childhood, Resentment, Basketball"

"Female rage is not often acknowledged - never mind written about - so one of the questions I'm asking is, 'Are you allowed to be this angry as you grow older as a woman?' But I'm also trying to trace where my anger came from. Who made me the person that is still so raw and angry? I think that it's empowering to ask that question.",Viv Albertine,"Angry, Mind, Grow"
"The Eyemo was heavy and could be noisy. Once, I was in an auditorium filming a speech made by Goebbels when, suddenly, it decided to emit a huge snarling sound. Goebbels froze, and hundreds of uniformed Brownshirts turned and glared at me in anger. It was not a comfortable moment.",Douglas Slocombe,"Moment, Me, Sound"

"I was the classic killer. I always played an angry man. I think it was because I used to really be like that - I was hostile. And because I had a good sense of theatrical truth, I used my anger and rebelliousness and just went with it. Anger was just a part of me.",Harry Dean Stanton,"Truth, Good, Always"
"I don't think I could play a character that I couldn't relate to somehow. I'm not unfamiliar with frustration, anger, shame, helplessness and a load of other emotions that make up our psycho-soup.
